What impresses me about the company is that have an absolutely ridiculous cadence of contracts announcements. We are talking new contracts week after week after week.

This has resulted produced a smooth as butter compounding machine that has recently inflected to positive ebidtda.

As far as valuation goes, it stacks of pretty damn nice. For example, far better grow and lower ev / sales multiple compared to it's closest peer PL.

Back in the day they had a strategic partnership with PLTR. Not notably sure if it is still ongoing:

In sum, I think BKSY occupies a really interesting niche (high res, low latency imagery) that will likely be able to command really nice margins over time. And they have the benefit of a good liquidity and positive growth, so probably don't need to worry about being hammered by financing - as is the typical case with satellite companies - all that much.

I am rolling with a good slug of commons, and some calls for extra juice.

My DD is based on the simple fact that analyst estimates for Q4 are way too optimistic. You can see (despite beat) a decline/flatening of the EPS.
Coupled with the rise of expectation (pic 2) it could lead to a miss and a similar situation than Feb 2024.

We also know for a fact that GOOG and MSFT missed expectations for their Cloud sector wich is the main revenue source from dropdox.

WMT Earnings and the Impending Selloff(üåàüêª porn),"TLDR:  WMT paints bleak picture of 2025, market goes down


Alright guys, I‚Äôve got my FD‚Äôs locked and loaded.  It‚Äôs not a huge play, only 3K worth, but they‚Äôre out the money and very short expiry.  I think WMT is going to tank the market tomorrow.  Walmart has historically been the ‚Äúcanary in the coal mine‚Äù when it comes to the US economy.  Being the largest retailer, it gives a good snapshot into the overall health of the American consumer.  Because of this, I think Walmart‚Äôs forecast tomorrow will be far bleaker than people are expecting, and the extremely out of touch stock market will get a reality check.  Here‚Äôs why:


1.  Consumers are tapped out.  Debt is at an all time high.  Delinquencies on credit cards and loans are at an all time high.  You may say, ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt this benefit Walmart since they are a discount retailer?‚Äù  Absolutely, and we‚Äôve seen Walmart killing it for the last year for this reason.  Even higher income individuals have turned to Walmart to save money.  But at some point, people just don‚Äôt have enough to spend on non-essentials.  So while Walmart continues to do fairly well, every other business begins to struggle and we start to hear rumblings of the R word.


2.  Slowing retail sales.  We saw a 1% drop in sales in January when only a 0.2% drop was expected.  Thats fairly significant, especially for the most important retailer in the US.  Just another piece that says that people aren‚Äôt spending nearly as much.  


3.  Inflation.  It‚Äôs back, and will get worse with the current administrations policies.  You may say ‚Äúwont that benefit businesses?‚Äù.  Yes it can, but if no one has any more money to spend, it wont.  Remember, during Covid everyone was saving money.  We couldn‚Äôt spend on experiences like bowling and cruises and what not.  Well over the past couple years, we HAVE been spending on experiences. A lot.  And not many people have much money left to spend on anything else.  So prices rising will mean greater costs for businesses, and they wont see the same spending patterns that they‚Äôve been seeing since 2021. 


4. Tariffs.  This is a known, but we don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre going to say about their forecast regarding tariffs.  About 60-70% of Walmart‚Äôs goods are imported from China.  Walmart accounts for 11% of ALL US imports from China.  These tariffs absolutely will affect them in some fashion.  Did they increase prices late last year to offset the cost?  Are they planning to increase soon?  We‚Äôll find out.  But one things is for sure: they will be increasing prices to strain an already overstrained consumer. 


5. Higher rates for longer.  I don‚Äôt think we will see a cut this year.  We simply cannot.  The new administration will fight tooth and nail for it, but i dont see Powell budging.  Inflation will continue to rise as more workers are deported and business increase their prices to combat tariffs.  Higher rates means M2 will continue to decline, reduced borrowing, and reduced spending.   


6.  Layoffs.   Walmart has recently cut over a thousand jobs.  This will probably be good thing for the company simply in terms of less costs, but they are one of many companies(Porsche, Salesforce, Workday, Amazon, Meta‚Ä¶) that have laid off a very significant number of employees recently.  Again, good for the particular business, bad for the overall economy.  


7.  Valuation.  Walmart has been on an insane tear all year.  It has been absolutely killing earnings, and honestly i think they‚Äôll kill this one.  But their guidance will be much softer than analysts are expecting.  Walmart‚Äôs P/E ratio is 42.88, that multiple will likely have to be reset if guidance is not stellar enough to justify the current stock price.  


8. Astrology.  For those that like crayons as much as i do, I‚Äôve included a few charts.  The main thing i want you to notice is the massive bearish divergences on WMT‚Äôs daily AND weekly charts, as well as SPY and QQQ(which looks like the weaker of the two).   Volume on the indices has been non-existent as well.  By market close today, 24 million shares of SPY had been traded(more were traded after market).  I could only find 3 instances of the volume being that low since 2010.  And it‚Äôs been like that for a few days.


All the signs of an impending recession are there, but the market has ignored everything so far.  I‚Äôm betting 3K in FD‚Äôs that the market starts taking those warnings seriously tomorrow and into Friday.  It is very likely I will lose this money, and that‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs just for fun.  But I‚Äôll be very happy if I was able to put the pieces together and see this before it happens.   If you made it this far, I appreciate you reading.  "

Is FTAI a Goldmine or Fraud? A Special Situation With Hedge Fund Action,"Alright, strap in and keep your seatbacks in the upright position because we‚Äôre about to take off into the best jet engine showdown since someone tried to fit an F-35 into a Spirit Airlines budget.

Now, I bought FTAI with the highly sophisticated investing strategy of ‚Äústock go down much, now stock go up‚Äù via a method I like to call Financial Darwinism. Thank you, past self, for your wisdom. I found out in a comment thread on a different post that apparently there are hedge funds brawling this one out which IMHO means we might get much hotter volatility:

üö® **In the blue corner:** Crossroads Capital, betting big that FTAI is a misunderstood gem with *huge* upside.

üî• **In the red corner:** Muddy Waters, yelling ‚Äúaccounting fraud!‚Äù like a finance bro who just discovered forensic auditing.

The stock‚Äôs been on a rollercoaster. Got hard dunked by a short report dove 50% and now on the mend. Here's the diligence you didn't know you needed to either wake up rich or staring into your brokerage account like the black box of a Boeing.

# Company Info & Key Developments

FTAI mooned from $17 to \~$175 between 2022 and 2025 because it shifted from aircraft leasing to high-margin engine services. In Jan 2025, Muddy Waters Research released a short report, alleging FTAI inflates earnings by misclassifying one-time engine sales as recurring revenue and artificially boosts EBITDA margins.

Timeline:

* 2022-2024: FTAI transitions from leasing to engine maintenance; stock climbs $17 ‚Üí $175.
* Jan 15, 2025: Muddy Waters releases a short report, claiming 80% of EBITDA comes from asset sales.
* Jan 18, 2025: FTAI‚Äôs Audit Committee launches an internal review and warns of potential 10-K delay.
* Jan 21, 2025: Stock crashes to \~$85, down nearly 50% from its peak.
* Late Jan 2025: Crossroads Capital defends FTAI, calling the selloff an overreaction.
* Early Feb 2025: FTAI signals 10-K will likely be filed on time; stock stabilizes around $100-$120.
* Upcoming: Audit results and 10-K expected soon‚Äîthis will dictate the stock‚Äôs next move.

# The Players: Two Hedge Funds, Opposing Theses

**Muddy Waters (Bear Case ‚Äì Short)**

Carson Block‚Äôs Muddy Waters Research is an activist short fund with a track record of exposing corporate misrepresentation.

Their Claim:

* FTAI misclassifies whole engine sales as maintenance revenue to exaggerate aftermarket growth.
* Up to 80% of EBITDA comes from asset sales, not true recurring services.
* Accounting maneuvers inflate margins, making the stock dangerously overvalued.

Muddy Waters expects the audit to confirm these concerns, sending the stock much lower.

**Crossroads Capital (Bull Case ‚Äì Long)**

Ryan O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs Crossroads Capital is a deep-value hedge fund specializing in misunderstood businesses.

Their Thesis:

* FTAI‚Äôs accounting is complex but not fraudulent‚ÄîMuddy Waters is twisting the narrative.
* A shift to clearer accounting in 2025 will remove confusion and boost transparency.
* CFM56 engine demand is surging, and FTAI is well-positioned.
* The stock‚Äôs collapse was an overreaction, creating a massive buying opportunity.

Crossroads sees FTAI re-rating to $150+ once the audit clears.

# Options Market: I Have No Idea What I'm Talking About

Implied Volatility Is Extreme

* IV is at 90-100%, meaning traders expect huge swings
* Heavy bets on both upside and downside
* March and April options have the highest open interest
* Put/call ratio is 0.77 so market leans slightly bullish
* Large positions in both calls and puts

Unusual Institutional Moves

* $3.1M in notional value traded in March $90 calls
* Hundreds of March $100 puts bought in large sweeps (institutional hedging?)
* High OI in calls

[Long the stock at $116.99](https://preview.redd.it/froubr60s5ke1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aba036f0b46fce3fd2ab06bc8bc90054edfeadd6)

**TLDR:** The market clearly expects a massive event but is split on direction. Even if it's fraud this fraud is management's full time job and they're apparently good at it. "
$SENS - The Sleeper Stock Set to Disrupt the $20B CGM Market with a Life-Changing 365-Day Sensor,"Hi Everyone,

Senseonics Holdings ($SENS), has been on my radar for quite some time, and I finally believe it's time for this company to take off. I first got into SENS back in the beginning of 2021, when it ran from pennies to dollars. This run was caused by hype around their Continuous Glucose Monitor products (CGM) that last 180 days, and 365 days, the important one being their CGM that lasts 365 days, called Eversense. Here is a brief explanation of a CGM:

Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) are medical devices designed to track blood glucose levels in real time throughout the day and night. They are primarily used by people with diabetes to help manage their condition more effectively, reducing the need for frequent fingerstick tests and providing a more comprehensive view of glucose trends.

How CGMs Work:

1. A small sensor is inserted under the skin (usually on the arm or abdomen) to measure glucose levels in interstitial fluid.
2. The sensor connects to a transmitter, which sends glucose data to a smartphone, receiver, or insulin pump.
3. Users can see their glucose readings at any time, track trends, and receive alerts for high or low blood sugar levels.

Dexcom, one of the leading CGM providers in diabetes cares CGM sensor only lasts up to 10 days, and transmitter only lasts up to 90 days. A CGM that lasts a full year is a complete game changer for diabetic patients. This product being available, means they no longer have to prick themselves, or get their sensors implanted every few months.

The problem, back in 2021, was that both the 180 day and 365 day CGMs were pre-FDA approval. Unfortunately, myself, and other investors, underestimated the time it would take this company to both file and be approved for selling of the 365 day CGM. This caused a loss of interest and investors to pull-out as they realized that it would take years for this product to materialize. However, that approval came late last year, and after 3 years of remaining sidelined and watching the company develop, I have decided it is time to reinvest in $SENS as their 365-day Eversense CGM is fully on the market in 2025.

**The following reasons are why I believe it is time for SENS to expand and take its place as the leader of CGM systems for diabetes management, overthrowing Dexcom.**

\# 1 - The Longest-Lasting CGM on the Market

Senseonics 365-Day CGM, Eversense, is the first CGM with a full-year lifespan, significantly reducing the burden of frequent sensor replacements.

The Eversense CGM offers a Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) of 8.5%, making it among the most accurate CGMs available.

\#2 - Expanding Insurance Coverage - A Key Growth Driver

Insurance adoption has been a major factor in CGM market expansion. While initially limited, coverage for Eversense has been steadily improving, including:

* Medicare Coverage: In February 2022, Medicare expanded coverage to include Eversense for eligible users.
* Private Insurers: Many large U.S. insurers, including Blue Cross Blue Shield, UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, and Aetna, have begun covering Eversense, improving affordability and adoption.
* State Medicaid Programs: Multiple Medicaid programs have included Eversense in their CGM coverage, increasing accessibility.

As CGMs become standard for diabetes management, more insurers are likely to cover long-term CGMs like Eversense, which could significantly boost adoption.

\#3 - European Market Expansion & 365-Day CGM Approval

Senseonics has submitted an application for European regulatory approval for its 365-day Eversense sensor, which could give it a significant first-mover advantage in the long-term CGM segment.

* Europe has less restrictive reimbursement policies than the U.S., potentially allowing for faster adoption.
* If approved, this would make Eversense the only full-year CGM on the market, setting it apart from competitors.
* Success in Europe would provide critical data and a commercialization roadmap for future U.S. approval.

\#4 - Search for an Insulin Pump Partner ‚Äì Key to the Closed-Loop System Market

CGMs are essential for automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, which integrate CGMs with insulin pumps to create closed-loop ‚Äúartificial pancreas‚Äù systems.

* Dexcom and Abbott already have partnerships with major insulin pump manufacturers like Tandem Diabetes Care ($TNDM) and Insulet ($PODD).
* Senseonics has expressed interest in partnering with an insulin pump manufacturer, which would open significant revenue streams and allow Eversense to integrate into the growing AID market.
* A partnership could increase CGM adoption as patients prefer seamless integration between their glucose monitoring and insulin delivery systems.

\#5 - Expanding Diabetes Market

* Global Diabetes Population: Over 537 million people worldwide have diabetes, projected to reach 783 million by 2045.
* CGM Market Expansion: Currently valued at over $20 billion, the CGM market is growing at a 10-12% CAGR, fueled by:
   * Rising diabetes prevalence.
   * Increased adoption of CGMs as the standard of care.
   * Expanding insurance reimbursement for CGM devices.
   * The growing trend of automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, which require CGMs for glucose data.

**Catalysts to Make Senseonics Take Off In The Near Future:**

1. Earnings Report on March 3rd - 2025 being the first full-year that Eversense is approved, Senseonics is expected to raise revenue guidance for 2025, and have grown revenue year over year from 2023 to 2024
2. Europe Approval - Senseonics filed for approval to sell Eversense in Europe, this month, and should receive decision on the next two months. Getting approved, and having access to this market, would be very bullish.
3. Cancellation of Reverse Split - With Senseonics recent price action, they have been able to cancel the need of a reverse split. Confirmation of this during the earnings call, will ensure investors that the future is bright for Senseonics.
4. Pump Partner Announcement - The anticipation for Senseonics to announce a pump partner has been big amongst investors, and is thought to be imminent with Eversenses 365 day approval last year.

After being too early, I sat and watched this stock for 3 full-years, and now believe it is time for Senseonics to make the right moves, and take off.

Senseonics is positioned for significant growth as it expands insurance coverage, seeks European regulatory approval for its 365-day CGM, and explores insulin pump partnerships. While adoption hurdles and financial risks remain, the company‚Äôs first-mover advantage in long-term CGMs could allow it to carve out a meaningful share of the growing CGM market.

You're not getting any inheritance. [DD],"Fries in the bag, chud.

You're not getting the inheritance you thought you were. Nana's bagholding life, and she's not going to let the suits take it from her without a fight.

**PART 1: The Setup**

https://preview.redd.it/97p7mlj7oxje1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f31f08a9ec7a038a13bff2fd9eb4be8dca05255e

Healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP is booming, and has no plans on stopping any time soon. The primary culprit is an aging population and long life expectancy, layered on a for-profit medical structure in the U.S.

https://preview.redd.it/i76cmpyeoxje1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=899d4f8f877b3b7d529eca3ef12b49ec0cc927c3

Over time, the proportion of the elderly U.S. population is projected to skyrocket, especially among the oldest cohorts.

[U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division. \(2020\)](https://preview.redd.it/9yrd2d9koxje1.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6796deeb368b85147b7981fe9104fb051e8b7f8)

And that inheritance your parents and grandparents have been bragging about for decades is getting dumped into long term care at a 10% CAGR.

https://preview.redd.it/iot8vl7uoxje1.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=990a8b60a91e93aeb5acdf76fe010c5c04758815

Fortunately, this is a trend even the most PLTR full-ported regard can understand.

People get old, old people are sick, sick people pay for healthcare, and in particular, old people pay for long term care (LTC).

https://preview.redd.it/edolo102pxje1.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=355e6331c2c2b2f4ab085f63f07c8235ff4595f9

So, how do you play it?

**PART 2: The Play**

Surprisingly, even with a braindead growth thesis, leaders in long term care are trading below conservative estimates of intrinsic value. Let's focus on some leaders: $PNTG, $NHC, $ADUS, $ENSG, $HCA

Of course, the meat of the thesis is future growth. All we know for sure about these companies is their track record. However, buying companies at low multiples to their historic operating incomes is never a bad idea, especially if there is no reason to believe they would suddenly lose that income stream.

Pennant Group Inc ($PNTG) is in Home Health and Hospice Services, and Senior Living Services.

Trading at 900M Marketcap, you're getting 13% CAGR on 35M in operating income. 25X operating income growing at 13% without any sign of stopping is already compelling.

https://preview.redd.it/1sepjddcqxje1.png?width=1187&format=png&auto=webp&s=703dccd68f8aea1f8c76197e8bfd897169d3d339

National HealthCare Corporation ($NHC) is in skilled nursing facilities, assisted and independent living facilities, homecare and hospice agencies, and health hospitals.¬†The valuation is even more compelling.

For 1.6B Marketcap, you're getting 6% CAGR on 20X operating income.

https://preview.redd.it/1umqjgakqxje1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7faa43a1ea1b4998c7fd1272a1f1a8599c1975a

But the best bit is your balance sheet. The company is trading at 1.6X P/B

https://preview.redd.it/w1grfqurqxje1.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d115278be69d4eb32865bc4a9265ed2eb486ede

Backing out the book value and goodwill, and then applying a conservative discount to book value at 700M. Subtract this from the 1.6B market cap, and for 900M market cap minus book value, you're getting \~80M in operating income with at least 6% growth. Pretty compelling.

Addus Homecare ($ADUS) looks great as well.

https://preview.redd.it/tvaewaafrxje1.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb63ab66587a6e3e417a2a60f072f9519d45de86

At 2B Marketcap, you're paying 20X operating income for 10% CAGR. Already compelling, but just like $NHC, you're also getting a massive margin of safety with a thicc book value.

https://preview.redd.it/39pmepmkrxje1.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b1a5f58574e368109f82a38a42953ee14205466

The Ensign Group ($ENSG) is the largest of these LTC providers. At 7.3B Marketcap, you're getting the company for a little over 20X operating income.

https://preview.redd.it/qyiwa9forxje1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=33076da03d71ae103f88c18b676b0267df082c3c

You might expect their growth to be lower being the largest player, but they have the highest CAGR of them all at 13%. Combined with a larger moat, better margins than the other players, it's incredible that this has such a reasonable multiple to income.

Finally, I want to throw in HCA Healthcare ($HCA), as it's a Michael Burry long and tangent to the thesis at reasonable valuation. They own and operate hospitals. Little less sexy as I think hospitals have riskier revenue streams, but the company has a ridiculous moat in hospital operations as the largest player by a mile. They're even bigger than the VA.

https://preview.redd.it/g6l1m67esxje1.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd9bd983f28ef788634a67195092b1a2c50dfb78

78B Market cap, 7.8X operating income. No brainer valuation here, and it helps widen the net of exposure to the thesis.

TLDR: Nana‚Äôs inheritance = my tendies. Boomers are bagholding life, and LTC stocks are going to benefit.¬†$PNTG $NHC $ADUS $ENSG $HCA for reasonably valued plays.

My positions:

$PARA YOLO - Undervalued Giant with Massive Upside Potential,"**Paramount Global ($PARA) is an undervalued giant hiding in plain sight.** The misunderstood fundamentals and exaggerated expectation for the death of traditional media has fueled a shockingly unique opportunity on a company that is fundamentally sound and poised for future growth due to its incredibly strong brands. Despite its negative reputation due to the Shari Redstone mismanagement of M&A and the difficulty that traditional media companies have been facing, $PARA is a massively undervalued media powerhouse with legendary brands in CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, Paramount Pictures, etc. This company is a media giant trading at fire sale prices. With a laughably low P/S ratio (\~0.24) and EV/EBITDA (\~5x), PARA is far cheaper than its competitors despite looking poised for a recovery, especially with the looming Skydance merger.

¬†

**Fundamentals:**

The fundamentals are honestly simple to me. Paramount has been struggling over the last few years to escape the difficulties that traditional media companies have been facing. They have been ineffective at creating enough revenue and operational efficiency/ focus to make any meaningful impact in their debt since about 2018 when their debt initially exploded upwards. Because of these factors, Wall Street and Retail have both soured on Paramount.

Paramount+ has been relatively successful, but the investment has not justified the returns thus far, however this aspect of their business has been steadily improving. In their last quarterly report, Paramount+ added 3.5M new subscribers, showing that the platform is still bringing in new customers. Beyond this, Paramount has exceptionally strong brands that are not going to die, no matter what comes of the future of media.

To further embolden the case for the intrinsic value hidden within Paramount, here are some of Paramount's Notable Brands: All of CBS, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, and quite a few more, with all associated brand IP (think SpongeBob, South Park, Avatar, The Daily Show, etc.). Point being, **these are brands that people interact with CONSTANTLY. Hours and hours of attention is spent on these brands each day.** And despite network cable‚Äôs viewership ‚Äúdecreasing‚Äù, CBS is still the #1 channel and rakes in about 4.8ish million viewers per day. Attention is the most valuable commodity in our world. Monetization of the traditional media platforms has been challenging, but with new leadership and the huge investment being made, **I am betting that they see incredible opportunity for growth with this company.**

I‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt mention that there are quite a few things that have been stacked against this stock for a long time, most notably the situation with 70% of controlling shares being held by Shari Redstone, who managed the company abysmally and ruined a potentially lucrative buyout for shareholders, making further M&A negotiations chaotic and unpredictable. However, she agreed to sell her control of the company in July of 2024 to Skydance, who will now be controlling the company with their current CEO, David Ellison (the son of Larry Ellison). **Shari being gone and competent leadership coming into the scene is a huge, huge deal. This merger has created a very unique situation for $PARA, which I believe to be a win-win for investors.**

¬†

Honestly, though, all of this is drivel. **What matters to me with the Paramount fundamentals is this**:

*Paramount's Market Cap:* $8B flat

*Paramount's TTM Revenue:* $28.9B

*Price to Book Ratio:* .43

*Price to Sales Ratio:* .24 (compare this to Netflix's PS ratio of 11.76, or even $WBD's of .64)

*EV / EBITDA:* \~5x (compare with Netflix of 17x, Disney \~10x)

The debt situation I have seen so much negative sentiment about online appears to be utterly overblown and I honestly don't see how people think this company is financially dying. Let me sum it up as follows:

*Debt to equity:* .94 (fine)

*Debt to assets:* .34 (good)

*Quick ratio:* 1.10

*Net margin:* \-.06 (trending better, hope this flips positive again soon, but I don't see reason for concern)

QoQ Total and Net Debt has been trending DOWN since Q2 2020

Free cash flow has been stably positive since Q3 of 2023, currently at $762M TTM

*Cash on hand:* $2.44B

Skydance merger will immediately inject $1.5B in capital once closed

There are deep value stocks, then there are‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. you know the rest.

**Technicals:**

Getting into the chart it seems evident to me that price has been pushed down about as far as it can be without something fundamentally changing. I like to buy my stocks at lows and sell them at highs (don‚Äôt you?). As you look through my TA, think about whether this price seems like a low or a high to you.

There are 3 timeframes that I will focus on; the monthly, weekly, and daily.

Please note that **current price is $11.30** at the time of writing this post

¬†

*Monthly*

https://preview.redd.it/yb9zabv1jxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=26f05db27a086c13828f255c0689bd27baeeef07

Macro Point of Control: $10.66 (price is above)

Macro Fibonacci Golden Pocket: $10.44-$11.68 (price is within and has held as strong support)

RSI: Bounced off bear zone and has been steadily (though slowly) rising since Feb 2024

MACD: Bullish divergence printed Oct 2023, has been steadily green and rising since Feb 2024, signal cross up in Jan 2024

Lastly, volume has been seeing some pretty significant influxes throughout this downtrend it‚Äôs been in since 2021 and volume has been consistently higher during this 4-year trend than it‚Äôs been at really any point since the 2008/2009 market shenanigans. This may indicate accumulation, especially so since 2024.

¬†

*Weekly*

¬†¬†

https://preview.redd.it/r8rhzvd4jxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=475549c3ca26b39b7f689e96e32796ae2050af68

The consolidation in the golden pocket is really beautiful. The fact that you had a significant bounce from the .65 to the .5¬†*exactly*¬†confirms the validity of using fibs on this chart and solidifies this golden pocket range as very strong support.

The weekly Bollinger Bands have squeezed to their 3rd tightest width in the history of this stock, and the narrowest they've been since January of 2018. Generally speaking, tight BBs lead to explosive price breakouts.

MACD and RSI have been printing bullish divergence for 3 years without much, if any, positive price action following. In my opinion this¬†*will*¬†change. Reversal in trend¬†*is*¬†imminent. There is a looming catalyst for this to reverse when the company reports earnings on Feb 26.

¬†

https://preview.redd.it/0tv16j253yje1.png?width=1043&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ef26c06db90cd9260b5f2553edfc3083c08b635

The Weekly ADX is actually beautiful. This is one of the lowest ADX values I've ever seen on a weekly chart for a company as big as $PARA, and it's starting to curl up. Simultaneously DMI+ is going up while DMI- is going down. This looks similar to the ADX setups $TSLA had in October of 2012 before a 535% run, $UPST had in June of 2024 before a 350% run (this one looks the most structurally similar to $PARA in many ways), $COST had in June of 2024 before a 100%+ run, $BABA in Apr 2024 before an 82% run, $INTC in June of 2017 before an 73% run, and $DIS before a 56% run. What I can't find is similar ADX setups that didn't have significant breakouts up or down.

¬†

https://preview.redd.it/ppnb1c0fjxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a4a872f8458bf897d8c5ca09e9899dd67dbf57

And how about a Triple Bottom on the weekly RSI just to further solidify my position of being on the precipice of a bullish breakout. It's not perfect, but chart patterns rarely are, and its close enough to be very intriguing.

¬†

*Daily*

https://preview.redd.it/w0b9k1h63yje1.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac18eef8caa65fbfc7c372e9b433b0d49cfa6a11

There are two chart patterns that are completing/ have completed. One is a falling wedge; the other is a pennant. The falling wedge has a price target of approximately $25. The pennant has a price target of approximately $5.26. Do you think it‚Äôs more likely that this company halves in value again, down to a $4b market cap, or *returns to a more reasonable valuation* of \~ $20b market cap?

There are also numerous gaps to the upside on the chart that I expect to be filled once a bullish trend reappears. Gaps are from \~$19-$23, \~$34.50-$36, and \~$85-$91.25.

https://preview.redd.it/xgawv1y73yje1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7bb02f718152b2fa47168a6ba1c20bef64b68b7

¬†The last thing that I want to highlight for is that the 50 and 200 daily moving averages are currently in a $0.20 range. There **will** be a golden cross very, very soon if price holds above $11. Algorithmic traders will rush in when this happens.

¬†

To summarize how bullish the technicals are:

1. Consolidating in a macro golden pocket above the point of control
2. Bullish divergence on the monthly MACD
3. 9 touches of bullish divergence on the weekly RSI & MACD
4. Weekly ADX is completely cracked out and looks poised for a **massive** run
5. Weekly RSI has a triple bottom with a very bullish outlook
6. Falling wedge pattern and gaps on the chart point towards a run deep into the $20 range
7. Daily golden cross is imminent if price holds above $11

¬†

**Some fun stuff:**

Short interest is 11% and the Days to Cover is \~13. While this isn't a huge amount in comparison to some previous meme stonks, this is quite significant for a stock the size of $PARA, and the size of this position is exemplified by the days to cover. When I compared this to Paramount‚Äôs competitors, I found that it is 3x-10x the short position of any other company in the sector. Additionally, I pulled the options flow data for the last 9 months to analyze the outstanding bearish premium. What I've found is what I believe to be a ticking time bomb. There is approximately $39M in net bearish put premium that is not closed, and $4M in net bearish call premium. This means that (in my opinion based on my analysis) there is approximately **$43M (22.46M shares worth of contract, or approximately 45% of free float) in net bearish premium yet to be closed**, that, if correct, will dump gasoline on the fire of a run if $PARA begins to break out and these positions are forced to close. These are trades that I believe to be held predominantly by Hedge Funds and institutions, and I believe that they are overexposed on this trade due to the belief that $15 is a price cap until merger. If price reverses and goes beyond the $15 buyout price, a mass unwinding of these positions (both the short positions AND the bearish contracts) will have to take place as the perceived price ""ceiling"" could be shattered.

¬†

*Final point:* \*securing tin foil hat and preparing for berating\* I believe that the options data I analyzed has uncovered a significant arbitrage play that is in the works. This Skydance-Paramount merger arbitrage trade is a ticking time bomb. Someone has been shorting PARA near $15 and hedging with bearish put options, betting that the deal price caps upside. But if PARA breaks and holds above $15, these trades fall apart, causing the holder to potentially cover their position, put holders to unwind, and institutions to scramble to reposition. This could trigger a cascade of buying pressure, breaking the artificial price ceiling and leading to a massive price surge. If the deal is renegotiated or collapses as a result of this price action, PARA could explode MUCH higher.

¬†

**Tldr;**

Paramount Global ($PARA) is an absurdly undervalued media giant that Wall Street has pushed down as far as it can, setting up what I believe to be a uniquely explosive opportunity. Despite owning powerhouse brands like CBS, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, and Paramount Pictures, $PARA trades at a laughably low valuation‚Äîits P/S ratio is just 0.24, its EV/EBITDA is \~5x, and it‚Äôs generating $28.9B in revenue on an $8B market cap. Meanwhile, short interest sits around 10% (\~12+ days to cover), and I‚Äôve identified $43M in outstanding net bearish premium (45% of free float exposed) still open, which I believe will act as gasoline on the fire if price begins to break out. Adding to the intrigue, the Skydance merger deal has created a forced price ceiling at $15, which institutions have been using to execute merger arbitrage trades‚Äîif that ceiling is broken, it could cause mass unwinding of short positions and a re-rating of the stock. Technicals are screaming reversal, with bullish divergence on multiple timeframes, the ADX setup mirroring historic breakout runs ($TSLA, $UPST, $DIS), and an imminent Golden Cross about to happen on the daily chart. If retail sentiment shifts and $PARA starts moving, this could be a perfect storm of undervaluation, squeeze potential, and institutional mispositioning, leading to a rapid and violent price correction to the upside. Everyone is sleeping on $PARA. It's time to wake up.

The Nebius Boys Are Trying to Speedrun the Entire AI Cloud Industry‚ÄîWill It Work? ($NBIS),"Nebius Group is the ultimate chip-on-the-shoulder company‚Äîliterally. Here‚Äôs a group of ex-Yandex billionaires, sitting in Amsterdam, staring at Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, and Satya Nadella‚Äôs mega yachts, foaming at the mouth, thinking:¬†*we built Google, Uber, and AWS for Russia, and we got stuck in Putin‚Äôs nightmare economy while these guys turned into gods.*

So now, they‚Äôre speedrunning the AI cloud industry, trying to go from zero to hyperscaler before AWS and Microsoft stomp them out. And Nvidia is helping fund it.

This company has a real shot at being Europe's AI cloud leader. They have world-class engineers, billions in cash, and might even have a cost advantage over AWS and Azure. But at $45+ per share, it‚Äôs priced like they‚Äôre already winning‚Äîand this is still an underdog story. The AI cloud market is a bloodbath. So this is either going to be a home run or an implosion.

# The AI Cloud Market: Welcome to the Thunderdome

This industry is a $260 billion warzone with three daddy figures‚ÄîAWS, Azure, and Google Cloud that are \~70% of the market.

These guys print more money in a quarter than Nebius might generate in a decade. They have:

* Infinite cash (Nebius has $2B in cash; Microsoft just spent $10B on CoreWeave¬†*alone*).
* Economies of scale (AWS probably gets better GPU pricing from Nvidia than Nebius ever will).
* Enterprise lock-in (Why switch to Nebius when AWS is integrated directly into your liver and kidneys?).

Then there‚Äôs CoreWeave, Lambda Labs, and every other AI cloud startup trying to steal GPU market share. These guys are expanding, backed by real American VCs who are smarter than me, and not run by bitter Russians on a redemption arc.

If Nebius wants to win, they need to execute perfectly and scale faster than anyone expects.

# How Could This Play Out? 

**Base Case (Most Likely)**

* Revenue grows to \~$1B in 2025 (in line with guidance).
* EBITDA is still negative due to high expansion costs.
* Stock price remains volatile but stabilizes around $35-$50 as execution risks become clearer.

**Bull Case (They Actually Win)**

* Nebius dominates AI cloud in Europe, taking market share from AWS.
* They hit $5-6B in revenue by 2030, reaching Azure-like margins.
* Stock goes to $100+, Nvidia buys a bigger stake, and Volozh finally gets a James Bond villain mega yacht.

**Bear Case (They Get Crushed)**

* AWS and Azure drop prices and build up trust in the EU, Nvidia pulls the rug, and Nebius is stuck paying top dollar for GPUs while customers go elsewhere.
* They burn through cash, have to dilute heavily, and stock collapses to $10-$15.
* Arkady Volozh sells GPUs on Telegram to stay afloat.

At $45+ per share, the stock is already priced for the Base Case five years out. The risk-reward setup here is not great for new buyers.

# How The Boys From Moscow Win

**""AI-Native Cloud"" ‚Äì Supposedly Can Compete with Hyperscalers**

* Nebius isn‚Äôt just another cloud company‚Äîit‚Äôs a full-stack AI-native platform.
* Their cloud software is optimized for AI, which means lower costs and higher efficiency for AI workloads.
* AWS and Azure are generalists‚ÄîNebius can win by being the best AI cloud for AI companies.

**20-25% Cheaper Than AWS and Azure**

* This is the whole bet‚Äîthat Nebius can undercut the big guys on price.
* If they can maintain this cost advantage, they can steal AI-native customers from hyperscalers.
* Nvidia‚Äôs backing gets them GPUs, but they still have to build and scale fast to maintain this lead.

**Nvidia‚Äôs Blessing (For Now)**

* Nvidia invested in Nebius, which means priority GPU access.
* If Nebius gets first dibs on Nvidia‚Äôs next-gen Blackwell chips, it could attract AI startups looking for top-tier hardware.
* But let‚Äôs be clear‚ÄîNvidia is not loyal. The second they find a better opportunity, they‚Äôll cut and run (see: SoundHound).

**Europe Needs an AI Cloud Leader**

* Europe is a regulatory nightmare, and US tech giants don‚Äôt want to deal with it. More data sovereignty laws (which the EU¬†*loves)*¬†could make Nebius the AI cloud default for EU businesses.
* Nebius is positioning itself as the ‚ÄúEuropean AI cloud‚Äù, investing $1B+ in EU data centers.
* If they become the default AI cloud in Europe, this stock could explode higher.

# How The Boys From Moscow Fail

**Capital Intensity ‚Äì This Industry Will Eat Them Alive**

* AI cloud is one of the most expensive businesses on Earth.
* AWS, Microsoft, and Google have an infinite budget.
* Nebius has $2B in cash, but they‚Äôll burn through it fast. They will have to raise more money.

**Nvidia Is Just Paying Itself**

* Nvidia‚Äôs investment isn‚Äôt a vote of confidence‚Äîit‚Äôs a revenue stream.
* Nebius needs GPUs, Nvidia needs to sell them‚Äîit‚Äôs a match made in financial engineering.
* If Nvidia sees better opportunities elsewhere, they‚Äôll ditch Nebius like they did SoundHound.

**Execution Risk ‚Äì No Room for Error**

* Expanding a cloud business is ridiculously hard.
* If Nebius mismanages scaling, pricing, or infrastructure, they‚Äôre dead.
* They have to grow exponentially while competing against trillion-dollar giants.

**Geopolitical Luggage**

* They may be Dutch on paper, but their leadership team is still Russian.
* Some big U.S. clients might hesitate to trust them, no matter how ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù they claim to be.
* If EU regulators suddenly turn hostile, Nebius could be screwed.

# Final Verdict: If You‚Äôre Buying at $45+, You Better Believe in Magic

Nebius is not cheap. At $45, it‚Äôs already pricing in hypergrowth, flawless execution, and Nvidia‚Äôs continued blessing.

**The Big Question: Do You Trust These Guys to Pull It Off?**

* If you think Volozh and his team are mad geniuses who will stop at nothing to get rich, buy it.
* If you think AWS, Azure, and CoreWeave will crush them like a bug, stay away.

At $25-$30 per share, Nebius would be a high-risk, high-reward AI bet. At $45+ per share, it‚Äôs degenerate gambling.

They have potential, but so did a thousand other cloud startups before them. If you‚Äôre buying at these levels, you better believe in destiny, vengeance, and the raw power of resentment-fueled innovation.

I'm long Nebius and I put together the above analysis.

**TLDR:**¬†My analysis indicates Nebius Group is priced to take off as hyperscaler. But this is going to be a capital-intensive bloodbath with Russians vs. trillion-dollar American megacaps who print more cash in a quarter than Nebius will see in five years. **At $45+ per share,¬†you have to be clinically insane to gamble on this before earnings.**¬†On the bright side, this management team might not get the best GPU pricing, but they probably do have an endless supply of cheap blow to enjoy while daydreaming about Larry Ellison-like villain arcs.

$DBX: Dropbox Took out a FAT LOAN to pump itself and avoid a pile of debt repayment in 2026. Will it work?,"
**TL/DR:üåàüêª Case (my personal prediction):
Stock stays below $38.25.
They pay the full $695.8M 2026 convertible note in cash instead of converting the debt to stock.
The $2 Billion loan for buybacks ends up being a leveraged bag hold, and 2026 refinancing happens under terrible conditions.
Short sellers feast on a liquidity crunch **

Alright, let‚Äôs see if I can get two of these üåàüêª wins in a row. I‚Äôm not normally a bear, but it‚Äôs hard to ignore this stuff. I nailed the $SXT failure last week and bagged 400% gains in a day after everyone said I was regarded (I kinda was joking but it worked) so maybe you degenerates need to listen up. Let‚Äôs talk about Dropbox ($DBX). You know, that account you signed up for in 2012 and then forgot about until last week when you remembered you had nudes of your ex, and needed to knock one out because your wife‚Äôs boyfriend won‚Äôt let you join in on the threesome at his house? Yeah, that company is still somehow worth $10 Billion dollars. I don‚Äôt have the kind of balls, patience, and money to buy short shares, but I would if I could. Who honestly looks at dropbox and thinks that in 2 years they‚Äôll be in a better position?

Aside from growth problems, they just took out a fat $2Bil loan from Blackstone for share buybacks, adding pressure to the ticking time bomb of debt coming due in 2026. And if the stock doesn‚Äôt pump soon, it is ripe to be targeted by shorties. They are obviously hoping they can pamp this thing over $38 to force conversion of their near term debt obligations into stock. I think that the powers at be already noticed this last year, and took the opportunity to smash the stock far away from the conversion price. Down 23% in a day for losing 50k users and weak guidance? Seems harsh unless someone wants them to go BK.

Pumping things up without growth is not new for them. The only difference is now they are borrowing to keep the buyback ride going. Between 2023 and 2024 they bought $1 billion in shares, but they don't have the cash to do that anymore. They also did big layoffs in 2023 and 2024, but they cant just keep firing everyone to meet shareholder expectations.
Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

üß® The Blackstone Loan: Instant Liquidity, Long-Term Pain?
$1B secured term loan from Blackstone (with an option for $1B more).
They didn‚Äôt use this to grow the business‚Äîthey used it to buy back stock ($1.2B repurchase program).
Unlike their 0% interest convertible notes from 2021, this new loan actually has interest (~7%), meaning Dropbox is now paying $70M in new annual debt expenses.

‚è≥ The Real Danger: 2026 Convertible Notes
Back in 2021, Dropbox issued $695.8M in convertible notes at $38.25 conversion price.
Guess what? The stock has NEVER hit $38.25 since then.
**If the stock stays below that by 2026, these notes don‚Äôt convert, and Dropbox has to pay the full $695.8M in cash.**
Oh yeah, and in 2028, another $693.3M comes due at $35.35.

‚úî If stock pumps above $38.25, problem solved‚Äînotes convert, no cash payout.
‚ùå If stock stays near where it is , they need to pay $695.8M out of pocket or refinance in much worse conditions in every way. There's zero chance they can refinance this at a better rate than 0%. Stock takes a big hit in this case.


So What Happens Next?
‚úÖ Best Case:
They suddenly figure out how to grow again (lol). More realistically, buybacks succeed in pushing DBX past $38, forcing debt conversion and avoiding a liquidity crunch. Stock is already up ~9% since December, likely from this effort. Must hit guidance - they fired 20% of the company to make sure of it.
‚ùå Worst Case:
No meaningful growth. Layoffs in engineering & sales suggest they aren‚Äôt innovating. The AI pivot flopped, and ‚ÄúDash‚Äù didn‚Äôt save them.
Severance cost them ~$100M, adding pressure.
If buybacks fail to push DBX past $38, they waste cash and still have to deal with refinancing.
2026 refinancing likely means higher interest rates, tanking valuation further.

Personally, I see no real reason why this stock isnt moving higher up right now. 112 is really low, and it should be mid 130s.

Here is a comparison with it's peers

https://preview.redd.it/cbp3ui63gvje1.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=a56d80903b6b7faa86167beed8bc4c88f37075b9

It's the only one that has been down. For why? No idea.

Its revenue growth is almost 20% YOY, a LOT higher than the average across the industry

64% gross profit margins? Come on those are lovely numbers

Sure, but let's talk about the downside.

I'm not a fan of how 98% of the shares are owned by outsiders. Insiders having low holdings is a bad sign

Altman Z Score is what I like. It means nothing here as it's the score given to ""likeliness to go bankrupt"", which none of these companies will. But, I still like the fact that it has better strength than the other companies, especially in comparison to GAP.

So, why is it down? I have no idea. My assumption is that, with all the tariff news, people think that clothing products in general will have lower sales as its a luxury. But, Eh, Abercrombie people like to buy Abercrombie, even if it means they gotta use money budgeted for rent, right? It has quite a few UP revisions for EPS reports, and I dont know when the 1 DOWN revision came about, but I assume it's the recent news saying that ""they expect lower growth"", aka instead of 20, maybe like 12? still better than the others?

$278k+ in LUNR. Here‚Äôs how to play,"Obviously do what you want. Not financial advice and whatever.

I posted DD a few weeks back about buying the dip on this stock. Back then it was 22 ish and I predicted it would have some potential dips before going higher. Well those dips happened and I hope you scooped up some longs or shares when it was in the 17s and 18s. If you didn‚Äôt, then guess what, you‚Äôre not too late yet because it closed last Friday in the 19s and ready to rip over the next two month back into the 20s and through the 30s.

Why?

Because it‚Äôs launch season again. Last year they landed on the moon and in the two week run up to the landing, it ripped as news coverage started on the launch, getting your every day Joe Schmo talking about it. Well you‚Äôre on WSB, so you might as well jump on it before the rest of the country finds out that we‚Äôre about to land on the moon again.

Launch window opens the 26th. That means the run up is about to start. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see it open up tomorrow already in the 20s, but don‚Äôt fear: any entrance in the 20s is a good entrance.

Last year the stock crashed a few days after launch. Why? It wasn‚Äôt a pump and dump. It‚Äôs cause the lander tipped over after landing. Is it going to tip over again? Highly unlikely. They spent the last year tripling and quadrupling up on their engineering to make sure that this time it‚Äôll nail its position as the de facto lunar landing system of any US moon missions for the next few decades.

I wouldn‚Äôt sell before launch. I wouldn‚Äôt sell after landing either. There might be some profit taking dips, but the stock is just going to keep going up as their successes materialize.

Even AFTER it lands and literally moons, you‚Äôve got earnings happening in late march a few weeks later, where they‚Äôll break down their successes to the press and announce their plans moving forward as space missions expand. Expect that earnings report to be massive as well and at the very least, hold your plays for the run up to that earnings before making your decision to exit right before earnings or hold for another hit.

You want a short term play? This is it.

You want a long term play? This is it.

Scared about tariffs and economic conditions like inflation and rate cuts? LUNR is its own thing. NASAs doing this no matter what happens to the economy because the new space race is here. Go google articles about China‚Äôs recent moon efforts.

I‚Äôm not saying that this is your last chance to get on. But this is your last chance at getting on before it becomes way more expensive. Get your ticket stamped and hold on for the ride for the next 8 weeks.

PTs:

25 by launch day
30 when it lands
35 a week after it lands
40 after smashing earnings
50 end of year
100 when it lands with a human inside by the end of the decade

Positions:

12,000x shares
90x calls (18c 3/21 which I‚Äôll roll for 3/28 after the landing)

$278,850 total and more than half my account.

BlackBerry: A Legacy Stock That‚Äôs Going To Get Re-Rated And Run,"BlackBerry is not a dead brand. It‚Äôs not a failed smartphone company. It‚Äôs not just another stock that spikes when retail traders pile in and then disappears.

It is a deeply entrenched, high-margin infrastructure software business that has gone completely unnoticed in the AI-driven rally. While every software stock remotely connected to AI, IoT, or automation trades at sky-high valuations, BlackBerry‚Äîwhich powers 255M+ vehicles and counting‚Äîstill trades like a company with no future.

The reality is different. BlackBerry dominates real-time, safety-critical automotive systems with its QNX operating system, and it‚Äôs now layering on a SaaS-like business with IVY, a cloud-based vehicle data platform co-developed with AWS.

IVY allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize vehicle sensor data in real time. This is exactly the kind of AI-adjacent, cloud-powered software business that should be trading at 10x revenue, yet the market assigns it zero value.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX is embedded in 255M+ vehicles and continues to expand at 20M+ per year.
* IVY has secured early adopters, including Foxconn‚Äôs MIH EV platform, Dongfeng, and Mitsubishi Electric.
* The cybersecurity division, generating $350M‚Äì$365M annually, is now stabilized and profitable.

Every other infrastructure software business with this kind of positioning has already been re-rated higher‚Äîthis one just hasn‚Äôt caught up yet.

# The Trade: BlackBerry Gets Re-Rated in the Next 2‚Äì3 Quarters‚ÄîPossibly as Soon as Earnings April 2nd

QNX is growing, IVY is ramping up, and cybersecurity has stabilized, yet the stock price still reflects none of this.

* If BlackBerry provides strong IVY guidance next earnings, the re-rating could start immediately.
* Even without IVY, QNX‚Äôs backlog alone justifies a higher multiple.
* Cybersecurity, previously a drag on performance, is now quietly generating cash.

This setup provides a margin of safety with significant upside.

Even if IVY takes time to scale, QNX alone is worth more than what the market is assigning to BlackBerry today.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as an infrastructure software business, it trades at $12‚Äì$18 in the next 2‚Äì3 quarters. That does not include IVY guidance or it's potential impact on price, which could drive the stock much higher.

# QNX: The Operating System Running Inside 255M+ Vehicles

QNX is not an infotainment OS‚Äîit‚Äôs the real-time, safety-critical software running inside automotive systems.

* Installed in 255M+ vehicles, growing by 20M+ per year
* $815M backlog (+27% YoY) ensures forward revenue visibility
* Trusted by nearly every major automaker, including BMW, Toyota, Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Honda, Stellantis, Bosch, Continental, Magna, and Denso

QNX is embedded in ADAS, digital instrument clusters, telematics, and secure gateways‚Äîsystems where failure is not an option. Automakers don‚Äôt replace this kind of software lightly, which is why QNX enjoys high retention and a long revenue tail.

As vehicles become more software-driven, QNX‚Äôs role is only growing.

* Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) require real-time OS solutions that QNX already dominates
* QNX Hypervisor enables multiple systems to run securely on a single chip, increasing its value per vehicle
* EVs and autonomous systems require low-latency, high-reliability computing‚Äîexactly what QNX provides

If QNX were valued like a strategic AI-driven infrastructure software provider, it would not be trading at 5x revenue.

A more appropriate 8‚Äì10x multiple puts QNX‚Äôs valuation at $2.5B‚Äì$3.5B alone.

Right now, the market is treating QNX like a legacy asset when it‚Äôs actually growing and gaining importance.

# IVY: The Unpriced SaaS Upside That Could Change the Entire Valuation

BlackBerry IVY is a co-developed vehicle data platform with AWS that allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize in-car data.

* Foxconn‚Äôs MIH EV platform, Dongfeng Motors, and Mitsubishi Electric have already signed on
* IVY enables software-driven revenue streams for automakers (subscriptions, upgrades, real-time analytics)
* BlackBerry captures recurring revenue from these services

Right now, the market assigns IVY zero value because revenue has not yet scaled.

But automakers are moving toward Tesla-style in-car software features, usage-based pricing, and over-the-air upgrades.

If IVY becomes the data layer that enables this shift, BlackBerry‚Äôs valuation moves toward SaaS multiples instead of just embedded software.

And we will know a lot more by next earnings.

# Cybersecurity: No Longer a Drag, Now a Cash Generator

For years, BlackBerry‚Äôs cybersecurity business was bloated and uncompetitive.

* Then management sold off Cylance, cut unnecessary costs, and focused on high-trust, high-retention government and enterprise contracts.
* Cybersecurity now generates $350M‚Äì$365M annually with a $280M ARR & Margins have improved to 65%
* Trusted by NATO, Fortune 500s, and government agencies

This is not a high-growth business, but it is a stable, profitable enterprise software business that the market is ignoring.

Even at a conservative 2‚Äì4x revenue multiple, cybersecurity alone could be worth $700M‚Äì$1.2B.

Right now, the market is treating this business as worthless, which makes no sense.

# Market Mispricing: How Big Is the Upside?

BlackBerry is currently trading at \~5x sales, significantly below comparable infrastructure software businesses.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as a legitimate infrastructure software provider, the stock is an easy double from here.

A reasonable valuation based on its components:

* QNX at 8‚Äì10x revenue ‚Üí $2.5B‚Äì$3.5B
* Cybersecurity at 2‚Äì4x revenue ‚Üí $700M‚Äì$1.2B
* IVY is completely unpriced‚Äîif it scales, it could be worth billions

**This pushes BlackBerry‚Äôs fair value toward $12‚Äì$18 in the next 2‚Äì3 quarters on the low end, $20+ on the high end if IVY scales.**

If IVY guidance is strong next earnings, that re-rating could start immediately.

# Final Thought: The Market Is About to Wake Up

This is not a meme stock revival.

It is an AI-adjacent, embedded infrastructure software business that has somehow escaped the AI stock rally.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX should not be trading like a no-growth legacy product
* IVY is being assigned zero value, despite real partnerships and revenue potential
* Cybersecurity is now a stable asset, not a liability

This stock is one strong IVY earnings guide away from a re-rating to juicy SAAS multiples. BlackBerry is almost certainly about to be priced like a great software company instead of a clown show. When that happens, it‚Äôs not trading anywhere near $5.69 anymore.

I‚Äôve put together the above analysis of BlackBerry. I work on these memos for my own personal investments and want to start sharing them. Thought you degens might like them.

I'm going to be posting diligence on reddit regularly, but only on r/wallstreetbets for positions in my personal book. Follow me on directly if you want to read more.

**TLDR:** My analysis indicates BlackBerry is a high-margin software business that the market doesn't believe could operate a coffee cart at an airport. Their IOT businesses includes the dominant OS for automotive software and an emerging SaaS platform co-developed with AWS both of which should command high multiples. The stock trades at a massive discount to comparable AI-adjacent infrastructure software businesses. In a base case, the stock should trade at $12‚Äì$18 in the next 2‚Äì3 quarters and if IOT guidance is strong next earnings it can pop to 20+."
This sector you've never touched is a 10-bagger. [DD],"I want to focus a sector that receives no love: Mining.

Trading at decade-lows with little investor interest, mining stocks today are like tech stocks in 2001. I'm going to show you how they have all the elements of a 10-bagger play, and how you should take advantage of the upcoming bull run

**PART 1: Qualities of a 10-Bagger**

Without overcomplicating things, a 10-bagger stock or industry can be summarized with these elements:

1. Left For Dead Prices - Prices that don't reflect the baked in value or potential growth of the company, especially compared to historic averages, since prices are typically mean-reverting.
2. Little Investor Participation - Trades that aren't crowded out by investors, muting potential future gains.
3. Ridiculous Potential - Massive margins of safety and explosive potential upside that lead to companies consistently growing their top line.

**PART 2: A Tale of Two Sectors**

https://preview.redd.it/a5aslgqpajje1.jpg?width=1341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5045ac70d14bd4b629332bac9984ad0c845b1829

You've been a regard for investing in mining over the past \~30 years. The index rose over \~5x, and you're flat. Any active manager in Mining stocks has either been fired or full-ported into Apple at this point.

It's even more stark when you compare to tech. Over the past 30 years, the tech sector delivered¬†\~5,000%¬†return, dwarfing the broader market‚Äôs¬†\~1,874%.

Investors have crowded the trade, leading to a situation where you nearly can't avoid exposure to the richly valued tech names:

https://preview.redd.it/47riv3obbjje1.jpg?width=1389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e31b8099d02c792cbb737a2f9ee17374f99ef163

Safe to say miners aren't included in any meaningful allocation in today's indexes.

But do they have the potential to 10x from here?

**PART 3: Left for Dead Prices**

The most compelling case for a 10-bagger is being cheap. Buying Apple at 10-15 PE in the 2010's is retrospectively a no-brainer. It gives you an incredible margin of safety if you're buying growth for value prices.

Miners are cyclical companies deeply exposed to the price of the ores they mine. Whether it's copper, silver, gold, or rare metals, miners generally scale with the price of their underlying commodity.

https://preview.redd.it/670ubnytljje1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=685e17313d2d2d33bed2d39c3733183eced31cba

For gold miners, this hasn't been the case. Despite gold roaring to highs around $2900 an ounce, the average gold miner is down over the past 20 years.

Many of these miners produce gold for less then $1000 an ounce and have been reinvesting their income into future production. Let's take a look under the hood at B2Gold $BTG

|B2Gold|Metrics|
|:-|:-|
|Total Assets|4,788,737K|
|Total Liabilities|1,599,657K|
|Book Value|\~3.2B|
|Market Cap|3.3B|
|TTM Operating Income|600Mln|
|5yr Avg Operating Income|672Mln|
|P/B|\~1X|
|P/OI|\~5X|

Wow. You're getting the company at book value today, and at a 20% income yield. It seems like it's deep value, so what are the growth prospects?

|B2Gold Company Expectations|Gold Ounces|
|:-|:-|
|2024|800K|
|2025|1Mln|
|2026|1.2Mln|

So what does this look like as far as their sales expectations? Let's see the price of gold:

https://preview.redd.it/00gmixjgnjje1.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2b3030a72eb4b41b4938d400eeac334db5b28fa

Compared to the company's reported all-in-sustaining-cost of producing gold at $1,200 an ounce, the company generates about \~$1700 an ounce in cash at today's prices. Who said you needed to be a tech stock to get 50%+ margins?

So, let's take a look at their 2026 projected gold ounces produced vs. some potential prices of gold. Assuming 1.2Mln ounces produced in 2026, here is their operating income:

|Cost of Production / Gold Price|$2000|$2500|$3000|$4000|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$1200\*|$960Mln|$1560Mln|$2160Mln|**$3360Mln**|
|$1400|$720Mln|$1320Mln|$1920Mln|$3120Mln|
|$1600|**$480Mln**|$1080Mln|$1680Mln|$2880Mln|

The company reports an AISC of $1200, but I've extrapolated this to 1,400 and 1,600 to account for worst case scenarios. Today's gold price is near $3000, but I've shown more bearish moves to $2000 an ounce to show worst case scenarios.

If you price in a 30% increase in costs and a 30% decline in gold price, the company is still trading at only **\~6X** their projected operating income.

So, an incredible margin of safety in the bear case scenario. What about a bull case scenario where costs remain the same but gold increases another 30% from here in 2026? The company will earn **3.3B** in operating income, which is the entire market capitalization. **You are potentially buying this company for 1 Forward P/E.**

The vast majority of junior gold miners have very similar fundamentals and future growth prospects. The entire industry is priced as if gold is falling +50% from here.

Similar miners are in the same boat. You don't have to look at gold. Let's take mega miner BHP Group $BHP for a ride. You're getting the company today for 5X 5 year average operating income as well, at 2X book value. Of course upside is more limited with a larger company, but the mineral diversification in BHP means that you benefit from price increases over many minerals.

**PART 4: Little Investor Participation**

Tell me this, when's the last time you saw someone shilling mining stocks on WSB? When's the last time a mining stock IPO'd on robinhood, or your friend showed you his mining tendies? There's basically zero investor interest left in the sector. It's tarnished by ESG, political risk, and just not being ""sexy"".

If you were an active manager following mining over the past 20 years, you lost your job. Why would anyone keep the regard that failed to beat the market for 20+ years?

https://preview.redd.it/2hl2u5drpjje1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=859518764be92fb4e04cfe5721935682f6d11d2b

The mining index has plummeted in comparison to its historic market participation. The pessimism is a clear setup for a multi-bagger contrarian play.

**PART 5: Ridiculous Potential**

I've already outlined an example miner for you to see the kinds of valuations present in the sector, but  the Junior Miner Index ($GDXJ) is filled to the brim with similar companies. When you look at a mining  industry's 20 year history on google, the chart looks like shit. But have they ever outperformed?

Mining stocks have generally been counter-cyclical: When markets fizzle out, they find their time to boom.

They surged in the Depression, mooned in the 70s inflation crisis:

https://preview.redd.it/zxc6j2nhqjje1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c32453a5afd3e8390247fd643c5191303f98714

https://preview.redd.it/c4hgv5ckqjje1.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=b43b557c4d3cf05889c6f1a13c96c4ec86e939cd

Specifically, they are counter-cyclical with Tech, and boomed during the last tech cycle wash in 2000:

https://preview.redd.it/5berkqxrqjje1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=b067f3c82ff2fd8fa3d4ff135feec946d5e9f3fa

And of course, the prices of the ores they're pulling out of the ground are expected to rise as well. Inflation is ripping the price of gold and looks to stop no time soon.

Steel and iron used for building is ramping up with urbanization and economic prosperity, whereas rare earth metals are finding their space in batteries, EVs, and semiconductors.

Copper is the backbone of electrification, and every single year the world breaks the previous year's record for humans living in urban environments. Global prosperity is the true secular bull market, and metals & mining are deeply connected to global growth in general.

Nearly all metals are also hedged to the growth of emerging markets, giving any US investors some necessary global exposure.

**PART 6: How to Play It**

Here's my takes on the best opportunities in mining:

|Opportunity|Sector|Justification|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Higher Opportunity|Individual small-cap miners ($BTG) \[Gold, Coal, Iron, Copper, ETC\]|Diving into individual names helps you avoid exposure to low quality companies in the indexes. Small caps have the best potential to scale earnings parabolically.|
||Junior Miner Index ($GDXJ)|General exposure to smallcap gold|
||Individual large-cap miners ($BHP)|While not as sensitive to price movements to the upside, large-caps are less sensitive to downside movements in the underlying commodities, and you can avoid some junk by diving into individual names|
||Metals & Mining ETFs ($PICK, $COPX)|Exposure beyond gold is great, as many of these miners across different metals have similar valuations and vary in their industry verticals.|
||Gold Miner ETF ($GDX)|General exposure to largecap gold|
|Lower Opportunity|Rare Earth Metals ($REMX)|While I think the same thesis is in tact for rare earth metal miners, their valuations trade at a substantial premium to the more ""classical"" miners of gold, silver, coal, iron, copper, nickel etc.|

My plays:

I'm long the following:

Reposting with positions."
Steel DD: Trump Tariff Time,"**Summary**

Before we knew Trump was getting elected we were looking at a reversion to the mean from the once in a lifetime bull market of 2021-2023. We also had China starting to dump insane amounts of steel globally. In 2024, China‚Äôs steel exports climbed to 110.72 million metric tons, reflecting a 22.7% rise from the prior year. Now we have across the board tariffs which include downstream products. These are a lot more bullish than the tariffs in 2018. GDP is growing and manufacturing PMI‚ÄôS are improving. Of note the ISM Manufacturing PMI turned positive for the first time in nearly two years. The Chicago PMI is still pretty crappy though. Overall things are looking quite bullish for the USA. If China can take off and stop exporting so much steel this would obviously be bullish globally. China steel exports are the #1 risk factor.

**Price Targets**

https://preview.redd.it/9fm0w6yzpjje1.png?width=1650&format=png&auto=webp&s=aba555d688056a7e9b29db7e81e02db0fc992179

**Selected Company Commentary**

**X**

The just finished a massive CAPEX cycle. Big River 2 is now starting to produce and the plant would probably cost $10 billion to build today. I believe X is a buy even as a standalone at this level. Huge plant in Slovakia could benefit if the war ends. In terms of the potential Nippon or other acquisition here are my thoughts:

1. Valuation Range 37-65+
2. Option A: Nippon buys $55
3. Option B: Nippon / CLF NUE JV $55. Nippon putting together bold/unprecedented proposal.
4. Option C: NUE / CLF Buy: Upper 30s, pushed to $45
5. Option D: Liquidation $65+ over $55
6. Option E: Standalone. To $49+ (Weeklies might die)

**STLD**

The best run steel company globally in my opinion. They are sort of a growth company disguised as a cyclical stock I saw somebody write. Strong downstream and internal pull on crude production. I love the move into Aluminum funded by FCF. Starting up in 2026 and hopefully STLD can do to aluminum what NUE and STLD did to steel. First new aluminum plant in the USA in 40 years.¬†

**NUE**

Largest and most diversified steel company in North America. I see more upside in STLD.

**CMC**

Great company. Some presence in Poland. Acquisition target IMO.

**TX**

10.3% Yield

$1.6 billion net cash

Always dirt cheap, someday that may change. Consistently profitable as well. 80% owned by a billionaire and non-USA which keeps the multiple down.

**CLF**

* I had this targeted for $5 before tariffs
* This stock is a huge raw bet on steel prices and trading vehicle
* Management is about getting big at any and all costs. This could work or backfire massively.
* Could end up with a sweetheart deal getting part of X
* Between getting sued by Mesabi Trust and U.S. Steel up possibly $3 billion+ in legal liability

**MT**

The stock everybody loves to hate. I believe they have been doing an excellent job. They should have about $1.9 billion in through-cycle EBITDA coming the next few years. Very low valuation.

"$GENI: Genius Sports, it‚Äôs literally in the name","$GENI: The No-Brainer Play Before Earnings

Alright, I‚Äôm going to make this simple. Genius Sports ($GENI) is about to take off, and if you‚Äôre not paying attention, you‚Äôre going to be that guy watching from the sidelines. This stock is setting up technically, has a major catalyst on deck (earnings), and is riding industry momentum that‚Äôs only getting stronger. Let‚Äôs get into it.

1. Earnings Are Coming (March 4) ‚Äì And They Look Good

We‚Äôre two weeks out from $GENI‚Äôs Q4 2024 earnings report, and the numbers already look solid:
	‚Ä¢	Revenue: Expected to hit $511M for 2024, up 24% YoY.
	‚Ä¢	EBITDA: Projected at $86M, a 61% increase.
	‚Ä¢	Cash Flow: Sitting on $135M in cash, up from $69M last quarter. That‚Äôs a huge boost in liquidity.

The company is clearly hitting its stride, and a strong earnings beat could send this stock moving fast.

2. The Chart Is Screaming ‚ÄúBreakout‚Äù

Look at the chart. Seriously, look at it.
	‚Ä¢	$10 is the final boss ‚Äì Once this breaks, there‚Äôs nothing stopping this from running to $15.50, and after that, the next major resistance is around $22.
	‚Ä¢	Volume spike ‚Äì The last breakout attempt had big volume behind it. Buyers are here.
	‚Ä¢	Momentum building ‚Äì RSI is in the sweet spot, MACD is turning bullish, and we‚Äôre coiling under resistance. It‚Äôs only a matter of time.

This is the kind of setup you want to see before a big catalyst.

3. DraftKings Just Gave Us the Green Light

DraftKings ($DKNG) reported earnings, and they crushed it:
	‚Ä¢	Revenue up 13% YoY to $1.39B.
	‚Ä¢	Upping 2025 guidance to $6.3B-$6.6B.
	‚Ä¢	Most important: They‚Äôre investing heavily in live/in-game betting, which is exactly where $GENI makes its money.

Here‚Äôs why that matters:
	‚Ä¢	Genius Sports earns 3x more on in-game bets vs. pre-game bets.
	‚Ä¢	The Super Bowl saw record live betting this year.
	‚Ä¢	Every sportsbook is going all-in on live betting, and they need $GENI‚Äôs real-time data to make it happen.

DraftKings is basically telling us that the sector is booming, and Genius Sports is positioned to print money because of it.

4. The Play? It‚Äôs Simple.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm holding 300+ $10 calls for April and July.
	‚Ä¢	Earnings are March 4 ‚Äì expect volatility, but the setup is too good to ignore.

If this breaks $10 with volume, we‚Äôre looking at $15-$16 with soooo much room to run after. 


TL;DR: $GENI is about to break out, earnings look strong, DraftKings just confirmed live betting (aka $GENI‚Äôs biggest money-maker) is growing like crazy, and we‚Äôre two weeks away from a major catalyst. The setup is there. Don‚Äôt miss out on probably the easiest play of the next few weeks, and possibly the year. "
The next potential candidate for S&P inclusion - Coin,"The Next s&p 500 inclusion - Coinbase

No one is talking about this so let‚Äôs discuss. Coin had a good run up day before earning reports. They had a good earning but stock tanked.

The next S&P 500 inclusion will happen on 21st March. We have seen what happens when they rebalance and add stocks like palantir..

I‚Äôm convinced coinbase will be the next candidate to be included next month. Posting here for a sanity check and blind spot.  Tell me why it should not be included.


Criteria for Inclusion in the S&P 500

A company must meet the following criteria to be selected by the Index Committee and be included in the S&P 500 index:

The company should be from the U.S. (fulfilled)

Its market cap must be at least $20.5 billion. Coin have more than 50 billion market cap (fulfilled) 


Its shares must be highly liquid. Coin have 10-20 million shares in average trading volume 

At least 10% of its outstanding shares must be available for public trading. Coinbase public float is around 20-30% (fulfilled)

It must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter. 
The sum of its earnings in the previous four quarters must be positive. (Fulfilled)


Reposting with disclosure as previous post was taken down. ( I have 400 shares in coinbase with average cost basis of around $232) which is almost 40% of my portfolio.

The Future of Battery Technology is Here! - Enovix,"Hey everyone,

I've been diving deep into the potential of Enovix lately, and I think this company might be gearing up to redefine the battery space as we know it. Here are a few reasons why I‚Äôm excited. I have 2000 share outside of this option play.

1. **Cutting-Edge 3D Battery Architecture:** Enovix‚Äôs innovative design isn‚Äôt just another incremental improvement. Their 3D architecture could pave the way for batteries with significantly higher energy densities, promising longer runtimes and more efficient energy storage.
2. **Market Disruption Potential:** With the growing demand for advanced energy storage‚Äîfrom electric vehicles to portable devices‚Äîtheir technology positions them to capture a big slice of a rapidly expanding market. Dont forget AI demand in battery tech yet.
3. **Strong Intellectual Property Portfolio:** Robust patents and a clear R&D roadmap suggest that Enovix is not only ahead in innovation but also prepared to defend its technological edge in a competitive landscape.
4. **Strategic Partnerships and Expanding Ecosystem:** Recent collaborations and moves towards commercial-scale production hint at an exciting future where Enovix could become a key player in the next generation of batteries.
5. **Growing Industry Buzz:** As more industry insiders take note, the chatter around Enovix isn‚Äôt just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs grounded in real technological promise and a vision that aligns with the future needs of energy storage.

$350k Bet on a Foreign Airline - The Bull Case for Air Canada,"Positions:

https://preview.redd.it/ynqr0i80j5je1.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc925b48b084ed2d9cc89a34dadc488add3faa6

Air Canada (AC.TO) released earnings yesterday. Revenue increased more than anticipated, and EPS was just as with projections. They were able to perform in-line with the bullish guidance that they'd provided earlier in the year, and announced a buyback of 10% of shares later this year. This company recently resolved a strike threat from its pilots, and are more profitable than they were a year ago.

Presently, Air Canada has a valuation of $6.3B. Based on market cap and region, its nearest comparable is American Airlines, which has a PE ratio of 13.5. Onex (the parent company of WestJet, which is Canada's other main airline) has a PE ratio of 7.9. Air Canada's current PE ratio is 2.6.

Given the positive guidance, the deep discount compared to its peers, and the relatively weak Canadian dollar right now, buying this seems like a no brainer. Even if the PE ratio were to climb to 6.5 (a 50% discount in comparison to its peers), this would correspond with a share price of $44.

That would be a 150% pump from the current share price of $17.75.

There's an opportunity here.

Herbalife ($HLF) is going to bounce back HARD after EARNINGS,"What's up snitches, I bet Herbalife ($HLF) is not the name you were expecting to see today when you opened up WSB.

**MISSION BRIEF**

For those of you that don't know Herbalife, it's a MLM pyramid scheme company that makes their affiliates sell Wendy's dumpster tier quality protein shakes to neighborhood moms. To makes things worse, the company is down \~90% from their ATH of \~$60 in 2021 to a mere \~$5.78 today based on quarter after quarter of growth decline. Luckily I can still post this DD on WSB as its just over the $500MM market cap requirement.

https://preview.redd.it/p2nojs4vg4je1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=d68cb393c7c63aac3915056c36f0beeb2922e998

And we're going to go LONG. Yes, LONG just like my pe...riodic losses in the market.

If you need some motivation for this trade or want to explore this HLF multiverse, go watch the 'Betting on Zero' documentary where you can see Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn battle it out over this stock. For the regarded ones among us, we will be roleplaying Carl Icahn for this one.

https://preview.redd.it/3wa3q7boi4je1.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=16dd4ed18b97ef9812117c6ee749699eae98a496

Now I hear you asking, why are we going long? This company looks like it's speed running bankruptcy and setting a WR while doing it. The answer is simple, ~~I have no idea what I am doing~~, big money and insiders are betting on it's survival and a rebound in the stock price.

**EARNINGS**

Earnings is coming up for HLF on Feb 19 2025. That is Wednesday after market close folks.  
Now lets look at the last few quarters of earnings:

* **Quarter Ending: Sep 30, 2024**
   * Expected EPS: $0.30
   * Actual EPS: $0.57
   * 1-Week Post-Earnings Stock Price Change: +24.2%
* **Quarter Ending: Jun 30, 2024**
   * Expected EPS: $0.39
   * Actual EPS: $0.54
   * 1-Week Post-Earnings Stock Price Change: -25.7%
* **Quarter Ending: Mar 31, 2024**
   * Expected EPS: $0.37
   * Actual EPS: $0.49
   * 1-Week Post-Earnings Stock Price Change: +15.9%
* **Quarter Ending: Dec 31, 2023**
   * Expected EPS: $0.39
   * Actual EPS: $0.28
   * 1-Week Post-Earnings Stock Price Change: -28.6%

Do you see the pattern? DO YOU SEE IT? Every earnings this mother father moves a lot. It moves 25% in a week like its nothing, filthy.

# Q2 2024 (April - June) ‚Äì ‚ÄúOne last dump‚Äù

* **Net Sales:** $1.3B (down 2.5% YOY)
* **Adjusted Net Income:** $54.8M
* **Gross Margin:** 77.9%
* **Office Sale:** Torrance HQ sold for $41M and leased back for 16 months
* **Debt Refinancing:** $1.6B completed earlier in the year
* **Restructuring Program:** $80M in annual savings expected in 2025

# Q3 2024 (July - September) ‚Äì ‚ÄúDebt Paid, Bags Made‚Äù

* **Net Sales:** $1.2B (down 3.2% YOY)
* **Adjusted Net Income:** $58M
* **Adjusted EBITDA:** $166.5M
* **Debt Reduction:** Paid down $85M of debt
* **Forward Guidance:** Raised full-year guidance

Basically, they know they're struggling and they're doing everything they can to reduce debt and reverse this trend. Q3 was the last positive quarter with a spike. The spike didn't last long at all and it sold off harshly after the first month (-40% to date) but we are aiming for that 25% spike again friends.

**INSIDER ACTIVITY**

So what are the insiders doing besides failing to run their ~~scam~~ company well? Well in 2024, the insiders we're mostly buying more shares from the $7 - $10.5 range. The number of buys was also significantly higher compared to other negative growth years. Granted its mostly one insider buying over the last year but the takeaway is, if they loved the stock at $8, they should REALLY love it in the $5.

**BIG MONEY**

Go to the options chain. LEAPS. **Jan 15'27 12.5C**.  
Do you see that open interest? Do you see that 10k contracts purchased at $90 a pop. Well my friends, that is a recently opened position and it was opened quite SWIFTLY. When the stock dumped last week from $6.50 to $5.30, this position was opened up quickly. This means these will print GAURANTEED.

There are also a lot of other option activity on the chain implying a big move one way or another. This one will be volatile on / after earnings day. Almost no chance it stays flat.

If you're not convinced at this point, then I'm afraid you leave me no choice but to talk about the....

**ANAL-YSTS**

There are a few analysts that cover this stock. Here are their recent ratings:

https://preview.redd.it/xjxij10rh4je1.png?width=1580&format=png&auto=webp&s=e379209b2a3e362c348328106f7fc0746643ef9a

They are still dishing out $7-$13 targets over the last half year. And I think they couldn't be more right. If this earnings is big GREEN like I predict, then the analysts will pile on with revised ratings sending it even higher.

I even emailed all the analysts covering this stock and while they did all ignore me, I got a vacation auto-response from one of them which is a BIG BULL SIGNAL. Probably on a cruise ship somewhere waiting for the big 50% gain day to drop.

**MORALITY CHECK**

Now it has to be said, I don't really care for MLM scam companies like Herbalife and ultimate would be happy to see them go bankrupt. But money is money, and by longing, I am playing both sides so that I always come out on top.

I literally can't lose!

"Why CRZBY is my ""crazy baby""!","Good day fellow crazy babies,

today I want to talk about one of the biggest German banks Commerzbank (CRZBY) and why I am heavily invested in them.



Honestly I won't bore you with the basics, but to summarize they have very good financials, with rising common business activity, profit, EPS, dividends and capital:

||2024|2023|2022|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||
|sales volume|11,9 B|22,5 B|14,6 B|12,2 B|
|profit|2,7 B|2 B|1,2 B|431 M|
|EPS (after tax)|2,28|1,63|0,99|0,23|
|dividends|0,65|0,35|0,2|0,00|
|capital|(no data)|527,8 B|491,9 B|473 B|

Yes, they do have debt, but it's a bank, that's their business model...



To the main topic, why is CRZBY going crazy and will continue doing so?

There are currently ongoing talks about a take-over from the Italian Unicredit bank. They are threatening a hostile take-over and already hold around 28% of shares, trying to increase their stakeholder power.

Meanwhile Commerzbank is trying to avoid a hostile take-over, but they are apparently not against a merger. We don't know the exact state of negotiations but looks like Unicredit will soon give a formal offer.

Of course to sell at the best price possible Commerzbank also has an interest in pushing the share price up, making them as expensive as possible to buy out. Hence insider buying is also going through the roof, indicading that Commerzbank is trying to ""defend"" by buying shares aswell.

As a result the share price has been going up and up and up and it will only go further up from here on.

The bank itself is already undervalued and if Unicredit succeeds with the take-over they will do so at atleast twice the shareprice giving the Commerzbank executives and other shareholders a real nice payout.



One thing to mention is the involvment of the German government: The German state is also a major shareholder and as a major German company they are not too happy about such a take-over, especially if it's going to be a hostile one.

But Unicredit chose a very wise time to attempt this. There is currently a re-election in Germany and the ruling parties have no time to worry about this situation, since they have to put all their resources into the election and their election campaigns.

And if there is a new government in 2 weeks (most likely), they'll first have other stuff to sort out.



As a result it is highly unlikely, that the government will put a stop to this take-over.



That's it for today, happy to hear all your opinions.

SMCI Bull Thesis,"SMCI BULLISH Thesis

This has been the most time I've ever spent researching a stock. So far, in matters of relevance, key indicators have been used based on relevant facts over BS fiction short seller reports. Let's look at historical facts and readily available information. SMCI company is BRUTALLY HONEST, and they are being reported as misleading. I will have every short summaries of all relevant information of last delisting, and recent late filing to instill confidence of actually reporting this time.  Adding more calls at open. For Mar 21. paper handed a ton already. over 5 k in profits. Been following since $18.already but the more I dig the more confidence I get. Will allocate more of those funds in intervals before Feb 20 as I believe that day will have huge news. Will probably not add any very long dates calls because I believe market cap will increase 100% by Mar21. Probably 300-500% by 27. But those profits for Mar21-April range are going to absolutely generate 1000s% anyways. 
 
This post indicates all relevant information and overlooks no available Info im confident. if I did post a comment as I‚Äôve got over 100 hours jn on this stock now. 

Keep in mind CEOs for SMCI and Nvidia are meeting DDN Feb 20 to discuss what DDN says as possibly ground breaking AI news. Black Stone just invested 300m into this Private equity company. I think we can use some of the words SMCI said in the last business update to make this information relevant like ‚ÄúConfidential new product line‚Äù he touched on this Feb 12. Let‚Äôs keep in mind SMCI offered 700M convertible notes. Not sure what‚Äôs about to roll out but I think SMCI was pummeled with legal fees and this news needs money like now. I‚Äôm almost certain we have filing before the Feb 25th. I say this 1) DDN Feb 20 2)Before 20th or after but before 25th release all filings1, 10ks, 3, 10Qs. 3) New CFO before 25. 4) NVIDIA discussing huge earnings with new news on huge upcoming projects. Maybe talking and pumping SMCI with proud partner getting ready for this huge BOOM. 
 Couple this with Trump, EU already talking HUNDREDS of billions will be dumped into AI over next 5 years. Couple this with trump possibly doing big tax cuts, like we‚Äôve seen in the past. And honestly couple this with the true news that this company is literally pulling in 10s of billions as they were in 2023 and are at half the market cap on all this BS news. I think SMCI priced in for SMCI not listing documents and going under selling OTC I‚Äôm being serious. 25b rev this year market cap 24b. This is going to change very soon. 

Information below this will give you more confidence that SMCI will 100% file based on being honest in the past. And some other miscellaneous things. 

1) September 14, 2017. The initial delay in 10-k. \*EXACT WORDS\* ""The Company is unable at this time to provide a date as to when the review and the audits will be completed."" this is over internal controls over financial reporting for June 30, 2017, 10-k... ""Company operating expense expected to be higher for the quarter because of legal and accounting costs.""

2) January 30, 2018. Fin info/Management changes/delayed sec filings update... ""Audit Committee completed disclosed investigation. We will need additional reviews before the finalized 10k report to determine if changes will need to be made. KEY UNABLE THIS TIME TO PROVIDE DATE FOR 10-K.""  Today's new CFO is Kevin Bauer. Needs plan update on FEB 28 for filings due March 13 ""SEC Compliance.""

3) FEB 20, 2018. The exact words 8 days before the deadline... I need more time for 10k and will request an extension on an update for FEB 28. If not granted, they said they had the option to appeal. (Was Granted) extended 180 days  

4) May 3, 2018, Fin/Info Because I'm transparent, I include all ""KEY POINT relevant updates to show endpoint differences in tones."" Back to update, ""Audit committee overseeing additional testing company believes it is nearing completion for \*current filings only\*. \*NOT INCLUDING 10K BACK TO BEARISH\*."" Then it directly goes back to saying additional testing is required to analyze the impact on the company's historical financial statements and complete 10k... Back to square 1. They say they will file 10Q for sep30,dec31, and March 31 after the 10k release, but there is no update, and they say additional time is needed for 10k. He still needs 10- K by August 24.

5) July30/Aug 7 4Q fin. Results were scheduled for August 7 after the announcement on July 30 and rescheduled to August 21, on August 7. It's horrible News, as the update was critical at this point because delisting would occur if reports were not filed on August 24... This is where I believe all the people claiming SMCI are crooks. \*But keep in mind at no point did they warrant 10-K was anywhere near ready but consistently diligent with saying current reports are looking good ""10Qs"", but 10 K still needs extensive care and has to be released first, then goes on and says 10K still needs to go through extensive testing for historical info throughout 2017-2018 going all the way to final update\* Yes this information for investors would warrant an even further upset failing to produce positive News for compliance. But again, at NO POINT DID SMCI EVER POST NEWS OF 10 K progress nearing completion up until or by AUG24.

6) August 21 4Q Fin/Info is irrelevant; it is a separate article. SEC FILINGS... It says, as we all know, extreme leaps were made, but they came up short due to the pure magnitude of historical information that needs to be audited. Remember that the AI wave is pumping in tons of new business, and companies need extensive capital for pure growth to come. And also being blasted by legal fees and accounting costs crippling this company's margins and ability to keep up with demand. But at NO POINT EVER INSIGHTED SIGNIFICANT VALUE IN THE PROOF OF RELEASE OF 10K.

Part 2. (1B) 2024/5 current news. (1B1) News compares/contrasts the 2018 delist to the 25 News and relists 2020. (1C) Deception of short sellers HIDENBUGER (closed)actual truths and findings of (EY).

1B) August 28 Delays 10K internal controls over Fin. Reporting.

2B) November 5: A special committee releases information/SEC filing update \* investigation is complete on concerns raised by EY. No fraud or misconduct was found.\* \*But for remedial measures, strengthen internal governance and oversight functions\* says unable to give a time frame on 10k filings\* No auditor is the reason for that

3B) November 18 new auditor BDO. Ask for a time extension. \*November 20 says they will have all updated audited 10ks and 10qs within the discretionary period\* if it is granted time. This, along with the request for late filings of current quarters, is 10 qs.

4(B) DDecember 2review independent committee. It talks about recommendations for a new CFO, executives, and strengthening measures with more experience. As well what was supposed to be assessed raised by EY. concerns ""(i) the integrity of the Company's senior management and Audit Committee, (ii) the commitment of the Company's senior management and Audit Committee to ensuring that the Company's financial statements are materially accurate, (iii) the Audit Committee's independence and ability to provide proper oversight over matters relating to financial reporting, and (iv) the tone at the top of the Company about rehiring certain former employees and financial reporting"" All concerns raised by EY appeared to hold no weight, and SMCI was compliant with independent committee everything came back good... Very import read SMCI IR December 2 2024 recommend reading full document. Also, SMCI says they believe they will have all filings within the discretionary period. February 25

5B) February 11, 2024 Fin. Update business call. They said they believe they will file all past and current, up-to-date quarterly and yearly forms. By February 25. They can't say anything more than this, but it's a dead giveaway compared to the reports in the past. Also, I subpoenaed the court for a short seller report from Aug(Hidenburg) And all the suits caused by this. SMCI says these are without merit and that no past statements need restatements. 

(1B1) January 9 2020 approved relist 14th first trade day.

(2B1) AUG 25, 2020 accounting investigation settlement. They never actually admitted to anything of fraud but indeed paid the settlement. Whether they cooked the books or not, they likely did. Do I find this necessarily bearish? For the time being, yes (2020). 

(3B1) Compared, some factors had near resemblances. Based on reports raised by Hidenburg, EY.

(4B1) In Contrast, there was a reasonable likelihood that 2024 issues were raised for external Speculation. In 2017/18, there was a valid reason to believe that SMCI was cooking books.

1C) Hindenburg reports, I'll be 1000% honest: this is the laziest report I've ever seen written. I'll go straight down the list. The statement is fear-mongering availability bias practice; Hurryand reminds them of 2018. Anyways,. It says SMCI was listed in 2018. Get this. I quote, ""By August 2020, found improperly reporting revenue and fined."" It would've taken half a second to realize this was, for instance, for 2018 delisting. I will tell you that Smci execs after relisting. I will say this with this statement about hiring three execs back 3 months after reinstatement to scare people that they're doing the same thing. No evidence for years after has ever been brought up about the. SEC heavily looked into SMCI after initially relisting. This is absolute madness. Well, I don't need to tell you this is false because there are about five statements down. The new CFO, extremely honest, goes even further in-depth several pages down. Later in the article,. It goes on and on about how great Kevin Bauer would never steal. Then, he says that SMCI cut his head in 2021 so they could get going. He talks about how the SEC liked him and how SMCI feared him being too fair and honest. But as mentioned, they were already improperly recording revenue 3 months after reinstatement. Then he seems to go on about them doing business with his brothers, about an industry I know well. It looks like this brother's company does sub-assembly, a massive manufacturing tool. I'm sure it's way cheaper labor overseas. Then, it acts as if SMCI is wrong for not disclosing them when they didn't have to until the filing. EY was also going through losing 84 companies because they were labeled the company with the most mistakes made by mad numbers. It costs 200 million dollars with all of these losses for EY. This was a perfect chance for EY to take the steam off their prior failures. Anyways, all the information claimed on SMCI has now been claimed as false. Not only this, but EY did all the 10-Q for 2023. Why did they wait until mid-Octoberr after Hindenburg reported a year after they did the auditing on every 10-Q prior to report all of SMCI fraud?

BigBear.AI (BBAI) -- Time to Get Off? Or go full regard? Here's my DD.,"*\*Second submission attempt with hopefully appropriate position screenshot\**

First, let me give credit where credit is due and give props to this BBAI rally we're witnessing. Pretty impressive, though speculative.

Please see my short position below and allow me to explain why I'm bearish on BBAI and why this party may come to an end soon if retail FOMO/hype runs out. I'll try to keep this high level and brief.

https://preview.redd.it/e400jt6zi0je1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23ba9b2b06c43c486b81abf2d48febd7491883e3

I wanna get into the catalysts that have started this rally. The typical news people praise includes the new CEO and his relationship with Trump, government contracts and backlog. I'll end by giving my thoughts on the stock.

**1. Kevin McAleenan, recently appointed CEO and former DHS Secretary under Trump**

There's speculation that with Trump back in the White House, McAleenan's past relationship with the President will be beneficial for BBAI and may help secure future contracts. I believe this is false and would go as far as saying it actually may be a detriment given their history and here's why:

* BBAI CEO Kevin McAleenan only served as DHS Secretary from April 11, 2019 to November 13, 2019 which was essentially a brief 7-month interim tenure. His tenure was not only short but publicized; CNN reported that Trump referred to him as an ""Obama guy"" and their relationship ran hot and cold. Additionally, Trump never officially stated if he would give McAleenan the position permanently. McAleenan resigned before we could see otherwise, becoming one of the shortest-serving secretaries in the department's history.¬†*Source:*¬†[Acting Homeland Security chief McAleenan was prepared to resign in June, felt undermined by subordinates](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/mcaleenan-immigration-hardliners-white-house/index.html)
* **BBAI CEO Kevin McAleenan on PBS, publicly spoke out about Trump and stated Trump's rhetoric during the attempted insurrection at the State Capitol created a dangerous situation. He went as far as saying that it was an assault on our democracy.**¬†*Source:*¬†[Former head of Homeland Security on the dangers of Trump's rhetoric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DNoXrWyJiw)

While I won't go as far to say they had a contentious relationship, it certainly appears that they may have lacked mutual respect for each other. You can do a quick google search to find more detail on this, there are a bunch of publications and articles available online speaking to BBAI CEO's resignation and speaking out about Trump.

**2. Government Contracts/Backlog (Financial Analysis)**

*Historical*

Based on historical 9/30/24 TTM, cash burn for operating activities was $23.4 million with cash reserves of $65.6 million that gives them just 2.8 years runway to operate and that's before debt servicing, taxes or extraordinary costs.¬†**So they essentially only have 3 more years of operations in their current financial condition.**

In regards to debt, they reported total debt of $196 million which has recently been restructured and extended from a 2026 maturity to a 2029 maturity. While this 3-year extension is a positive note, it cancelled their $25 million working capital revolver and BBAI will likely need to find additional financing to support operations in the near future.¬†**Given their current leveraged debt position, they will likely not be able to find traditional bank financing which leads them to**¬†**trade equity for cash AKA additional issuance of shares or more dilution**.

BBAI has been and will remain upside down for the foreseeable future. They also do not hold any meaningful tangible assets in a liquidation scenario, most of their assets contain intangible assets (software IP) and Goodwill (acquisition).

*Forward-looking*

Management reports ending backlog at 9/30/24 was $437 million. Unfortunately detail for each contract is not publicly available but we can make some assumptions.

* We know the Army contract is $165 million over 5 years (we'll assume straight-line for simplicity). If we assume the same gross profit margin of \~26% reported for the 9/30/24 period; the Army contract would provide $8.6 million in annual gross profit or $715 thousand monthly gross income.
* $272 million would be remaining in backlog and if assuming a 10 year duration this would provide $7.1 million in annual gross profit or $59 thousand monthly gross income. I'm assuming that the FAA contract is the next largest and that was disclosed to have a 10 year duration. I think this is a reasonable assumption.
* In total we have $15.7 million in annual gross profit for at least the next 5 years. Keep in mind this is also assuming there are no issues/delays with deliverables/work-in-progress or contract draws. My math also assumes that backlog amount is unchanged at the start of 2025 (most likely lower given the work done in Q4 2024).
* OpEX -- TTM operating expenses were reported at $86.6 million which is a monthly amount of $7.2 million. I think it's also important to keep in mind that OpEx has been increasing period over period and that shouldn't be a surprise given the need for R&D in the AI space and scaling of operations like increased headcount to accommodate additional contracts/work size. Engineers aren't cheap but Glassdoor says differently in BBAI's case, which I'll talk about more below.
* So keeping all that rough math in mind, we have about¬†**$70.9 million in annual operating losses**¬†or $5.9 million in monthly operating losses projected in this year.¬†**This is before taking into account debt repayment ($196 million), taxes, or any extraordinary costs that may arise (litigation, bad things, etc.). It also assumes they run into no bumps along the way, operationally, which they have already stated is to be expected and comes with the AI territory. The AI space is a highly competitive space and with everything the Trump administration/DOGE are getting their hands in, I believe there is not only operational risk but reasonable contract risk.**¬†This share price is obviously not reflecting the fundamentals. People are saying one more contract to the moon when in reality BBAI needs contracts just to get to sea-level.
* I should note that these figures do not include the recent contracts from the Navy ($5 billion) and DOD/CDAO ($1.3 million). The reason being, I consider the DOD/CDAO contract nominal at $1.3 million. More importantly, we have no idea how the Navy's SeaPort NxG contract is structured for BBAI besides the news that they've been included in the program and the total program's contract amount. There are thousands of vendors/companies who also have access to this $5 billion. For example. BBAI was among 1,023 companies that were awarded rolling admissions (2nd round) and access to the $5 billion Navy program.¬†**Including first and second round, there are over 2,400 companies accepted in the Navy's SeaPort NxG program. Admitted vendors still compete/bid and are awarded contracts within this bubble. This is not guaranteed revenue. It's essentially on an Ad Hoc basis. This is the case with the FAA contract as well.**¬†*Sources:*¬†[Navy Selects Over 1K Vendors for SeaPort NxG Contract Under 2nd Rolling Admissions](https://www.govconwire.com/2025/01/navy-selects-over-1k-vendors-seaport-nxg-contract-2nd-rolling-admissions/)¬†|¬†[Harnessing Power, Navigating Change... TAKE THE HELM FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICE SOLUTIONS](https://www.navsea.navy.mil/Business-Partnerships/SeaPort-NxG/)
* Quick and dirty math, the above assumptions would get us -$60.2 million in EBITDA (assuming $10.7 million depreciation addback) which would give us a P/S ratio of -0.24x based on 252 million outstanding shares. This ultimately equates to a P/E ratio of -41.7x if we assume an average share price of $10. All non-sense numbers in a nutshell.
* Additionally, they will have $12 million in annual interest expense on their $200 million facility and income taxes will increase with increased income which was previously reported at $22 million for 9-month 9/30/24.
* BBAI's¬†[GlassDoor.com](http://glassdoor.com/)¬†employee reviews reek of the same sentiment with some reviews **this year** going as far as saying *""No clear direction from management and no standard operating procedure""*, *""Whenever it is time to renew the contract for a project, there is issues with government funding which causes delays and even sometime a furlough""*, and *""Never able to bring the 3 distinct companies together as one. C-Suite selling shares like there's no tomorrow. No new contracts that I've seen""*.¬†**Summarized as bad work/life balance, paused inflationary raises (losing money to inflation while working there), lack of direction from management, high turnover, etc.**¬†*Source:*¬†[GlassDoor: BigBear.ai overview](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-BigBear-ai-EI_IE4857471.11,21.htm)

**Closing Thoughts**

Take my numbers/analysis with a grain of salt.

From a business standpoint, it's not all peaches and cream on the horizon for BBAI -- they are churning and burning with a high need to keep product development and contract generation at a consistently high level. Two very difficult and costly things to do in the AI space.

I have concerns over their financial condition, internal processes, and future cash flow as they do not seem to exist.

Stock price is insanely high for a business that's never turned a profit. Just because it has a few new contracts? Its got the new debt to match too, don't forget.

Not to mention the reputation to boom and bust around this time of year.

I do not know the timing but I think they will likely issue more shares to take advantage of this price action. This thing ain't just going to keep going up and they need all the capital they can get.

Future contracts are not guaranteed, management knows this so they will be constantly exploring ways to secure additional liquidity/working capital...most obvious place for that is share issuance AKA lower share pricing.

I'll end with this -- it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out, especially with the long weekend and earnings being around the corner. I feel like there's still a lot of hype and FOMO, however, I think the stock is overvalued and overbought.

Look at the short interest, I'm not the only one who thinks this.

Wish ya'll the best, hope everyone does well.

I welcome discussion on convincing me to go long.

This is not financial advice."
Spotify Buy/Sell/Holf,"Spotify Buy/Sell/Hold, is it overvalued?

I've been bullish on SPOT for years, started buying at $73 in 2022 and DCA'd up to a cost basis of $120, so I've done well so far but is my original thesis playing out and still intact?

**OG Thesis:**

My original thesis, shortened so we can focus on today and the future: The majority of Spotify users are ad tier (at the time around 60%), but they made up less than 15% of revenue. Spotify was focused on growing MAUs instead of real monetization, but once the MAU growth starts to slow they will pivot more into monetization. I'm not concerned about more ads scaring away users, some will go to Subscriber tier and the others weren't profitable anyway, since Spotify's expenses are somewhat tied to how many listens they get having less listeners that aren't profitable isn't necessarily bad. Additionally, Spotify started getting into podcasts and I saw that being a driver of future growth. Lastly, I think they have pricing power on subscriptions.

**Past Performance:**

So how has Spotify done over the last 2 years (from Q2 22 to Q4 24)?

|\#'s in Thousands|Q2 2022|Q4 2024|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|MAUs|433|678|54.3%|
|Revenue|2,864|4,242|48.1%|
|Net Income|(125)|367|393.6%|
|Free Cash flow|37|877|2,270.3%|

Key factors tying to my thesis: 2022 Ad tier MAU was 59.12% and contributed to 12.52% of revenue. In 2024 it was 62.96% and 12.66% respectively.

My thoughts based on my original thesis: I did expect Ad tier MAU to begin to contribute more to revenue by now, especially with being an even larger percent of MAU. I like to invest thinking 5 years ahead minimum, so at the time I was thinking by 2027 Ad tier should contribute to 30% of revenue (while maintaining around the 60% of MAU area), there is time left for them to get to the 30% area I wanted to see but I did expect to see SOME improvement. Spotify is also still growing MAU at >10% so I will give some slack in not fully monetizing yet. Spotify has done 2-3 Sub tier price increases with another one announced, so I was right they have pricing power (I wish they used it more on ad tier than loyal Subscribers tho). I am happy with their podcast growth, thankful they realized to cut their podcast spending though.

Overall thoughts: Clearly Spotify figured out the cost cutting and improved FCF and net income at a very healthy clip. I'm also generally happy with the MAU growth but slightly disappointed in Revenue growth. Back to the Ad tier not carrying their weight there. I'm also very pleased with the introduction of audiobooks and video integration. Both I think can be growth drivers with video having huge potential. Personally, as a user, I think they are pricing audiobooks too aggressively for it to do as well as it can.

**Spotify's future:**

I did my own rough estimates for their MAU, revenue, and FCF in 10 years. Then I did an estimate using Spotify's target 1B MAU by 2030 and expanding growth another 5 years.

My method:

I used 4%/yr MAU growth (Subs growing 6% and Ad 2.5%). I won't bore you with too much info, but I made 6 revenue estimates using varying growth of Rev/MAU for Ad and Sub tier. Then I estimated each estimates FCF using 15% (current rate), 20% and 25%.

**M1**

|In thousands|Minimum Estimate|Max Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|29,028|92,227|
|**Free Cash Flow**|5,854|23,057|

Now using Spotifys estimate of 1B MAU by 2030 then 5%/yr to 2035. I used the same method for revenue and FCF estimates.

**M2**

|In thousands|Minimum Estimate|Max Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|47,964|118,578|
|**Free Cash Flow**|7,195|29,681|

My minimum revenue estimates used 3%/yr growth rev/MAU for both Ad and Sub tier. My max uses 8% for subs and 31% for ad tier BUT with a 10% cut to ad tier MAU to account for upset users. Figures based on average yearly revenue per user, See below:

|Tier|FY 2024 Average|Minimum Estimate|Max Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ad|56|75|120|
|Subscriber|5|7|75|

**Valuation:**

I like reverse DCF calcs to find what todays valuation should be. For my estimates I used 4% terminal growth and 11% Discount rate. For estimates with Spotify MAU growth I used 3% terminal and 11% Discount rate, with the faster growth I expect less runway for the terminal growth. I will show my RDCF valuations for the Average and Max FCF estimates, not the minimum since it is absolutely overvalued if it doesn't surpass min estimates.

Price today: **$647.66**

|Average M1|Max M1|Average M2|Max M2|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|548.26|841.90|638.41|958.93|
|(15.35%)|30.50%|\-1.13%|48.17%|

**Final Thoughts:**

As the valuations show, Spotify has upside if they surpass some pretty hefty targets. But even hitting my average estimates doesn't give much upside at the current price, M2 average assumes 23.5% FCF growth for 10 yrs which is no joke. I'm still bullish on the company, but I'm **Holding** for now with buying as an option on a 12%+ dip from current prices.

**Thesis going forward:**

My original thesis is mostly still in play. I see a future where monetizing the ad tier can lead to significant growth.  Podcasts, audiobooks and video have huge potential and can drive growth the hit my highest estimates. Podcasts and audiobooks gives support to price increases and better advertising opportunities while also having higher potential margins due to less royalties. Video can drive more streaming hours and grab some market share from Youtube or other streamers. Spotify is integrating it slowly and they didn't mention tapping into a youtube-like video platform but if they can successfully pull it off any market share gain will lead to better than expected growth.

For me to buy more I will like to see video progress and/or higher ad RPU or achieving 15%+ Subscriber growth. At current valuations I don't see a way to justify the valuation with less than 25% of revenue coming from Ad tier. It just isn't sustainable to raise subscription prices enough to justify the valuation, which is why 15%+ growth here could sway me to buy.

Selling would involve losing MAU without significantly increasing ad tier RPU, stagnant MAU and RPU growth, or ad tier growing higher than 65% without contributing more than 15% of revenue. I'd probably sell some if it increases above $730, it'd be my first 10-bagger and over-priced for me. So I'd want to lock in that kind of gain and buy again at a better valuation.

$SXT ‚Äì THE DYING RAINBOW: worse for your portfolio than Red5," 

Listen up, degenerates. Tomorrow, the **Skittles Factory of Wall Street**, otherwise known as **Sensient Technologies ($SXT)**, drops its earnings. And I‚Äôm here to tell you why this thing is about to get curb-stomped harder than a bag of Doritos in a fat kid‚Äôs backpack.

1. FDA Just Banned Red Dye No. 3 ‚Äì And This Is Just the Beginning
Last week, the FDA officially banned Red Dye No. 3 in foods and medicines, citing health risks. This isn‚Äôt just some fringe move‚Äîconsumer and regulatory pressure against artificial additives is growing. Sensient relies heavily on artificial colors and flavors, and while they do have ‚Äúnatural‚Äù alternatives, the reality is that these regulations chip away at their core business.

RFK Jr. isn‚Äôt behind this ban, but his stance on ultra-processed foods and chemicals in the food system makes it clear: more restrictions are coming. If the government keeps tightening the noose on artificial ingredients, Sensient is in trouble.

2. Junk Food Demand Is Down, and Inflation Isn‚Äôt Helping
Most of Sensient‚Äôs biggest customers are processed food companies‚Äîthe same ones that load up on artificial coloring and flavoring. But with inflation squeezing consumer wallets, people are buying fewer unnecessary products.

Shoppers are sticking to basic essentials instead of splurging on premium snacks, candies, and artificially flavored drinks.
Big food brands are raising prices, but they can‚Äôt pass all the costs down, which means they‚Äôre cutting back on suppliers‚Äîand Sensient is one of them.
This demand slowdown is a serious problem because Sensient doesn‚Äôt control pricing power. They‚Äôre at the mercy of major food companies, and when those companies cut costs, suppliers like SXT feel the pain first.

Analyzing Undervalued Tech: Intels Semiconductor Manufacturing,"Alright bonobos, I put all my creativity into making a title that spells AUTISM so I hope that will be enough to make you at least skip all this text and read the TL;DR of this post. While I start this of in WSB style the content is supposed to be serious. I'm writing this post in tribute to Nana and hope her regarded grandson is still holding. üôè

I will cover:

* Product Status
* CEO Status
* Geopolitical Developments
* Notable 13F Filings
* Sentiment
* My Position

**Product Status**

So the main take I see on X and Reddit is that Intel's products suck and their financials are even worse. Well guess what, that take is still valid today. And what's worse about this situation? TSMC is the one producing these products.

So, that part is the reason why Intel's market cap is now only 37% of Palantir's but that might also be the worst possible comparison I can make at this point.

Now onto the positives. Intel recently released consumer GPUs which are called Battlemage. These are already highly praised in subreddits about pc building and seen from the posts are also often out of stock and even scalped like it's 2021 again. They are also releasing new CPUs with naming schemes that are harder than they were but here too the first benchmarks are looking very good (like the Ultra 9 275HX).

These new designs in combination with switfly improving drivers are not the big revenue drivers but it is a clear hint to what they're capable of.

The most important thing about product is that they claim to be on schedule to start 18A high volume manufacturing (HVM) in H2 2025. 18A is a new node technique that is capable of laserbeaming transistors closer together than anyone else including TSMC, meaning chips with higher transistor density. They are also planning on allowing others (like Microsoft) to fabricate their own design chips on this node.

**CEO Status**

Keeping this one short, it will be former GlobalFoundries CEO Tom Caulfield but this news just still has to officially drop sometime soon. (Ok... I'm not 100% sure about this but currently this is the most likely scenario and sentiment about him on socials appears to be very good).

**Geopolitical Developments**

Do I really have to explain this?! If Intel pulls of 18A HVM, they are the only (American) company producing these high tech chips. We know Trumps administration gets hard from hearing the words domestic production and I bet they prefer Intel over TSMCs fabs because well... even with fabs in America it still has Taiwan in its name.

Then early this week we also had this quote from JD Vance on CNN:

*Vance also mentioned other touchstones of Trump‚Äôs administration, saying that, ‚Äúto safeguard America‚Äôs advantage,‚Äù it will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the US with American-designed and manufactured chips.*

At the same time Intel VP:

*Intel vice president just said in the AI SUMMIT that chips used for AI will be designed and ‚Äòproduced‚Äô in the US.*

So after these developments and knowing 18A HVM is coming soon. What I think is most interesting here (hopefully not going fully conspiracy theorist): Why is the Trump administration delaying tariffs on chips specifically? Are they.... are they waiting for... they're not waiting for... right?!?!¬†**Imagine...**

**Notable 13F Filings:**

Alright so, companies with >100M USD are required by the SEC to disclose their trades through a form called 13F which most of you will likely know. The rules for 13F are that they have to file within 45 days after quarter end. Q4 2024 = December 31st. Add 45 days and you get February 14th, add some SEC processing time and the peak of new filings usually hits 15-17th of February meaning for now I have to use the info from Q3.

Overall 13F shows that in Q3 institutions total holdings decreased which, given purely the financials, makes sense (algo say money bad = sell), but that's how your boomer pension funds work. We can also look at the people who will try to fuck us over (and make money) like... Citadel. Even Citadel is boring compared to the next one but Citadel is LOADING up on shares and calls.

Most interesting? Jane Street. These guys are the super nerds that predict the market and are also market¬†~~manipulators~~¬†makers. They sold, but that's not the full story. While they have/had a lot of puts which they increased by 18% in Q3, they also increased their calls by 450%. Their new filing for Q4 will likely show another hard trend in this direction.

**Sentiment**

So as we've already seen this week, sentiment is changing in Intel's favor. People are cautiously regaining confidence in their products and that combined with a very favorable administration and a new node could make this one of the most interesting plays one can do in 2025.

**My position**

I got burned around Nana time (believe that was Q2 ER last year) and lost about 10k USD. Got back in over the past few weeks with a 20$ avg. for 3000 shares.

   * ***Answer***:*TL;DR*: **our TCO (Total Cost of Operations to the AI customer) is so good that even when the competitor's chips are free, it's not cheap enough.**""We have more competition than anyone on the planet has competition. Not only do we have competition from competitors, we have competition from our customers, and I'm the only competitor to a customer fully knowing they're about to design a chip to replace ours, and I show them not only what my current chip is, I show them what my next chip is, and I'll show them what my chip after that is.And the reason for that is because, look, if you don't make an attempt at explaining why you're good at something, they'll never get a chance to buy your products. And so, we're completely open book in working with just about everybody in the industry.And the reason for that‚Äîour advantage‚Äîis several. What we're about is several things. Whereas you could build a chip to be good at one particular algorithm, remember, computing is more than even Transformers. There's this idea called Transformers; there's a whole bunch of species of Transformers, and there are new Transformers being invented as we speak. And the number of different types of software is really quite rich.And so, we can accelerate that. We can accelerate quantum physics. We can accelerate Schr√∂dinger's equations. We can accelerate just about everything‚Äîfluids, particles, lots and lots of code.And so, what NVIDIA is good at is the general field of accelerated computing. One of them is generative AI. And so, for a data center that wants to have a lot of customers‚Äîsome in financial services, some in manufacturing, and so on‚Äîin the world of computing, we're a great standard. We're in every single cloud, we're in every single computer company, and so our company's architecture has become a standard, if you will, after some 30-some years. And so, that's really our advantage.If a customer can do something specifically that's more cost-effective, quite frankly, I'm even surprised by that. And the reason for that is this: Remember, our chip is only part of it. Think of when you see computers these days‚Äîit's not a computer like a laptop. It's a computer, it's a data center, and you have to operate it. And so, people who buy and sell chips think about the price of chips. People who operate data centers think about **the cost of operations (TCO)**‚Äîour *time to deployment, our performance, our utilization, our flexibility across all these different applications in total* allows our operations cost‚Äîthey call it total cost of operations, TCO‚Äî**our TCO is so good that even when the competitor's chips are free, it's not cheap enough**. And that is our goal‚Äîto add so much value that the alternative is not about cost. And so, of course, that takes a lot of hard work, and we have to keep innovating and things like that, and we don't take anything for granted. But we have a lot of competitors.""
* **Perplexity AI CEO**: [https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1889668709356023942](https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1889668709356023942) ""Need to clarify this in no ambiguous terms: We still think **NVIDIA is peerless and singular and the industry leader by far. And nothing changes in our relationship with them**. I like Andrew and Cerebras team and they have really done good work in helping us achieve the 1200 tok/sec. It‚Äôs primarily the quality of our post training and the value of the data we have collected as a product that‚Äôs serving so many millions of users that got us to be better than the lightweight OpenAI and Anthropic models and on-par with the bigger ones. **All this was done on NVIDIA GPUs**. We benefitted a lot from Llama 3.3 that was trained with a ton of NVIDIA GPUs. We still **serve majority of the models we serve on production on NVIDIA GPUs**, eg custom versions of Llama and DeepSeek R1. **Cerebras or Grok are not robust chips** that can handle both dense models and sparse MoEs yet. NVIDIA chips can do any model class really efficiently. Cerebras is still bound by capacity constraints. I wish the Cerebras team and Andrew the best and glad we‚Äôre working with them and I think competition is good for the industry and will push NVIDIA to innovate faster on Blackwell and next generation of chips. But, *I do not appreciate any clickbait PR that claims Perplexity is moving away from NVIDIA or NVIDIA moats are disappearing*. We did not participate in that PR ourselves.""

**On DeepSeek:**  
The viral blog was authored by Jeffrey Emanuel (BA, Reed College, 2005), who does not hail from an AI background (academic or industrial), and does not have experience at a top-firm of their field (buy-side, or sell-side, or IB). So, the infamous blog which caused a flash crash of 600B in a day, may not be well founded and may feel sloppy to say the least. Prior AI investment experience does not necessarily evoke sound understanding to identify bloated claims from research papers. All it created was a stampede in a crowded theatre of people who wanted to be the first one out of the stampede, and are too scared to go back in, after it was found to be a hoax. The Chain-of-Thought concept explored in the paper is not new, and has been there for quite a few years. The paper took a departure from regular fine-tuning and relied on CoT processes which produces more grounded responses. The total cost of creating the model was grossly understated, and the results released in their paper was selectively shared, while it underperforms on few non-reported metrics.The AI research community needs just the very best GPUs to carry out their experiments, serving models via inference is just one aspect where people may even try to customize their specialized chips  (see Jensen's response in earlier point), but the superpower of NVDA chips is how far ahead they are for the competition to even catch up, that AMD CEO famously stated that NVDA chips are so far ahead, that they chose to not compete with NVDA in creating the best chips - someone can link the news piece, if they have it readily available.

**On Need for more compute**:  
While it may be noted that GenAI is mostly task-based, and not AGI, a challenge most researchers are figuring out rather than beating another state-of-the-art performance on yet another curated dataset.  
**The most understated aspect is that model developers need the most state-of-the-art devices so as to not be constrained in their experiments and prefer general purpose devices for experiments to create breakthroughs. There will always be firms playing catchups and creating optimization, while industry leaders will strive to stay ahead as opposed to becoming an IBM, who stayed stuck in the older era of computing.**

**NVDA GPU backlogs**:  
The GPU orders are so backlogged, that prompted the AMZN CEO Andy Jassy to mention his investment in proprietary chips, to let users have a choice of cheaper chips, despite them not being the very best (see earlier section on his ER comments for added context): ""customers that they want better price performance on their AI workloads. As customers approach higher scale in their implementations, they realize quickly that AI can get costly. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. The second version of Trainium, Trainium2 is starting to ramp up in the next few weeks and will be very compelling for customers on price performance.""  
Also refer to other chipmakers like AVGO and Cerebras. *Counter*: See the earlier point made by Perplexity CEO.

While there will always be competitors as Jensen stated in section 3, they are well aware of their moat, and while there is always another social media app competing with Facebook (META), there is always a leader, and leads to better products and aggressive growth, rather then devolving into an IBM. As an example, one would strive to hire a top scientist from a top-school, as opposed to hire a person self-taught in their basement and using their local-resources. As always, exceptions exist.

**Moat** (outside of the earlier point on competition note by Jensen):  
This segment is over and above NVDA CEO Jensen's (pre Deepseek) and Perplexity's comments (post Deepseek). Keeping this additional segment short, and invite readers to read up further on it, since it is more technical than the rest of the thesis.I have been using CUDA since 2013, which many *current GenAI experts (recently-minted from deepseek fiasco)* may not have had a chance to explore. Some of their other propietary technologies are CUDA, nCCL, cuDNN, TesorRT, NVLink, MIG, OptiX, DOCA (Data Center-on-a-Chip Architecture).AMD & Intel don‚Äôt have a CUDA alternative (ROCm is underdeveloped, and Intel's OneAPI is not competitive). NVIDIA‚Äôs ecosystem (CUDA + TensorRT + hardware) is an end-to-end solution that competitors lack.

**Quantum**:  
They have been invested in Quantum technologies, and are hosting the upcoming""***NVIDIA GTC 2025: Quantum Day to Illuminate the Future of Quantum Computing***"" [https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gtc-2025-quantum-day/](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gtc-2025-quantum-day/), March 17-21, 2025: ""At the first-of-its-kind event, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang will host industry leaders to discuss where quantum computing is headed"".

While I can not comment on the ethicality of his recent quantum jab, but they have been very heavily invested in R&D in this space.While Quantum has two main approaches (annealing, and gate-based), one of which is currently usable (annealing) and the other (gate-based) is currently experimental. NVDA may have recognized this and I suspect his comment was aimed at the gate-based quantum approach.

**Conclusion**:  
I need to go to sleep, so have to call it a day and wrap it up, although there are some additions on how the fear generated by a half-baked viral blog by Emanuel Jeffrey, that may have been necessary, but nevertheless was unfounded. It is understandable, since the AI revolution may be seen as having three facets: a) the model creators, b) model use-case creators, and c) AI users. From my understanding of people, the people in the model-creators segment are not necessarily very vocal, except in research efforts and publications, and not as visible in the wall-street or media. As always, exceptions exist.

$INTC The most hated 10 bagger that will make grandma proud,"TLDR; only truly American fab. With AI race at full speed, semiconductor hardware (NOT SOFTWARE) will become the defining strategic resource of the superpowers. 


People will say oh but TSMC is better at production, but NVDA designs better chips, but AMD. We have to take a trip through the history of TSMC and its founder Morris Chang as well as the cold war. 

Let's look at Morris. He went to Harvard and MIT and then stayed in the US to work for Texas Instruments for 30 years, obtaining his American citizenship in the process. 30 years is more time than many in this app have lived thus far. I'd say he's an American through and through. He was next in line for the position of CEO at TI, but ultimately because he was of Chinese descent he was turned down for the role. Now, at the age of 55, the Taiwanese government reached out to him to fund a fab company; TSMC is born. 

AI will be more important than the space race and the nuclear arms race. The implications are so profound that nations are no longer cooperating to build it together and are strategically trying to limit the advancement of their enemies; e.g. blocking Nividia chip sales to China. The most effective embargo is a hardware embargo. 

With national security at stake, if they didn't trust Morris to run TI, what would make them trust TSMC to be the sole provider of chips to America? And on a side note, with TSMC in Taiwan and the vast majority of chips being produced in a country neighboring China, that risk level is over 9000. China is already designing and producing their own  chips with varying degrees of success. You guys can fill in the blank of what the US government fears the most. It is absolutely crucial to have production back in the US. 

That leaves us with the only option, Intel. It is the only company that has a full white lineage of leadership. Real American Company as some would say.

Ultimate CELH dip to rip üöÄüöÄüöÄ,"So an opportunity has presented itself and I want to share it with my regarded brothers. While rotating as a medical student at different hospitals across the country, one thing that was common amongst them: all doctors, residents, nurses, etc all had Celsius on tap in their hands. Compared to coffee, it tastes better, doesn‚Äôt stain their pearly whites, ver convenient, and was easy to sip on not being hot. At one of the largest hospitals in the world in Houston, Texas, they had a lounge where there was always plenty of Celsius available to keep these people working. 

Point being Celsius consumption is through the roof while their stock has gone down incredibly low (-74% over the last year). 

While it continues to get beaten down, I believe this provided a great chance for a bounce play, or being bought out by Pepsico, who already has a roughly 10% stake in them.

Rocket Lab is more than a meme stock üöÄ,"Rocket Lab (RKLB) had a great run in 2024. After hitting a quintuple bottom at $3.47 in April 2024, it broke out of a three year bear-market and rallied 690% to $27.44 last Friday, at 12.3 billion market cap. While the rocketing stock price seems too hot to touch, the stock is just getting started.

* Electron rocket has solidified its reputation in the industry. There are only three companies capable of reusable rockets: SpaceX, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin.
* Neutron is going to be the true challenger to Falcon 9, this year's maiden launch is major catalyst for the stock.
* RKLB is vertically integrated space company, capable of satellite manufacturing, rocket launch, and space system support (rocket launch contributes only 30% of the company revenue).

# Electron Rocket

The small **reusable** rocket carved a niche market out of Falcon 9. Electron cost 7.5 million (now raised to 8.5 million) per launch with 300 kg payload. Falcon 9 cost $70 million with 23 tons payload. While the cost-per-kilo is obviously worse for Electron, it is a commonly misunderstood metric. You don't buy a fraction of the rocket by multiply cost-per-kilo with your payload weight. You either buy the whole rocket, or ride-share with other passengers. Electron is like UberX, you book it at anytime, go anywhere, depart anytime, and reschedule as you wish. Falcon9 is like carpool. You wait for all the passengers to get onboard, and only leave at a time when it works for everyone.

Electron has [16 launches in 2024](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/missions-launched/) with 100% success rate. Notably it launched two missions within 24 hours on Nov 24 and 25, on its **two private-owned spaceports** in New Zealand and USA. Booking an Electron rocket is easy as booking UberX for space.

[100&#37; success rate in 2024](https://preview.redd.it/a5tu81w04aie1.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebd10344389bda651c69eaf96a9849d166c76059)

# Neutron Rocket

Everyone knows about Electron at this point. If RKLB were just about Electron, it would be overvalued now. But few people understand the Neutron yet. This is a medium-lift rocket comparable to Falcon 9. When it was first announced, it was scoffed at for its dull resemblance to Falcon 9. Then something amazing happened. Neutron design morphed into a **BBC rocket ‚Äì a chubby, black, sexy dildo shape**. While its competitors are still trying to clone Falcon 9, Neutron has been redesigned from first principles, and ready to shock the space industry.

>It's a rocket from 2050. ‚Äì Rocket Lab CEO, Peter Beck

[The \\""unexciting\\"" Falcon 9 clone](https://preview.redd.it/ys7qsv4ky9ie1.png?width=3070&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c3e00d7f7516140655f36f57d8d1ca52378cec6)

[Neutron design: before vs after](https://preview.redd.it/udf1ig5xu9ie1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7820434a993364e5029010fbd5d1b62d7970635c)

***Second Stage Rocket Redesign***

Unlike its competitors which stack second stage rocket on top of the first stage. The second stage rocket is placed inside the first stage. The tip of the rocket (fairing) opens up like a hippo mouth to spit out the second stage rocket. It comes with 3 advantages:

* The second stage is protected from aerodynamic forces. So the second stage doesn't have to be aerodynamic. It can be any shape you like.
* The second stage is protected by the fairings, which are permanently attached to the rocket Unlike Falcon 9 which discards the fairings, Neutron designed its fairing to be an integral part of the rocket for rapid reuse.
* Because other rockets place the second stage on top of first stage. The second stage is subject to compression force as the rocket goes up. Neutron ""hangs"" the second stage inside, pulling the second stage upward. What difference does this make: Neutron carbon fiber is much stronger under tension than compression. This makes the second stage much simpler and more fuel-efficient. Rocket Lab is the carbon fiber alchemist. They can 3D-print carbon fiber faster than Fed can print QE.

I took the summary from the video [Who wins the reusability race](https://youtu.be/Ynebk_71sxM?si=oIw-miQnUnPleC_I&t=480). It's an in-depth video that every RKLB investor should watch.

[Neutron \\""Hungry Hippo\\"" fairing opening and releasing stage 2](https://preview.redd.it/mpgk5myz3bie1.jpg?width=1120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe7d655fa9bb61ad031a5992ed7ff141dac5a179)

**iPhone Moment**  
When Neutron hits the market, it will be the iPhone moment of Space. We have seen enough homogenous looking rockets stacking one stage on another, with more and more fuels. Neutron achieves better reusability (fairing) and fuel efficiency through radical redesign. It is built from first principle, ignoring what everyone else has been doing.

The radical redesign is like Apples ""think different."" This is not the only trait that reminds me of Apple. RKLB's obsession with vertical integration reminds me of how Apple obsesses with user experience from hardware to software. The clean, minimalistic design of the Electron rocket and the launch pad stands in stark contrast to other rockets which must launch with wired ""ICU"" life-support tower. Neutron takes one step further. It is designed to launch and land on its own, without any fancy structure on the ground.

[Clean & crisp Electron launch](https://preview.redd.it/jynjk528aaie1.png?width=1686&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5076fdba6aeec0a6d4e947def84950787b98762)

**Engineering Excellence**

The market has not priced in Neutron success. It's first flight was supposed to happen in 2024 but delayed to 2025. Delay sucks but it's not uncommon in space. But it also means catalyst is still ahead of us.

Elon Musk intentionally kept SpaceX private in order to shield it from public pressure. SpaceX can blow up rockets and burned R&D cash with abandon. Rocket Lab does not have such luxury. It is under immense pressure to deliver. Their engineering track record is stellar. Rocket Lab's Electron cost 100M R&D to get to orbit and plan to spend just 300M on Neutron. Falcon rockets cost \~2.5B in R&D (excluding Falcon heavy).

Will Neutron succeed on its first try? I don't think the stock has priced it in. Even Falcon 9 had two in-flight failures and one pre-flight failure. Few people are expecting Neutron to succeed on first try. But the possibility is not zero. Electron rocket almost entered orbit on its first launch. It was aborted due to a communication glitch on the ground, causing the operator to destroy the rocket. If their engineers keep on pushing, they might deliver the biggest surprise to rocket history.

# Other DD

**Survival of the fittest:** The three year bear market hit space industry hard. The weak competitors have been shaken out. Virgin Galactic and Momentus stock prices are in the toilet. Virgin Orbit has gone bankrupt. Astra Space has been taken private after 99% stock crash. The survivors of the bear markets are the fittest.

**Peter Beck**: a humble genius workaholic. He has no college degree, got massive balls, strapped rocket engines to his bike and went full YOLO, applied to NASA, hated its bureaucracy, then quit to start his own rocket company. He was talking about how to build rocket at age 32. He's still talking about it today. He's dedicated to one thing his entire life. And at age 49, he's still full of LIFE.

[Peter Beck demonstrating the art of YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/dfol6j53odie1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d08c28ffb6953d3f5c60c8a6a5e1a719192dfecc)

**Political tailwind:** With Orange man in the House, Elon Musk as space cheerleader, and Nasa new chief Jared Isaacman who likes Rocket Lab, we are entering a very favorable 4-year term for the space industry.

**About SpaceX**: SpaceX is unquestionably the king of space. I can only say, space is BIG. It's more than enough for one company to thrive. The political detachment of RKLB is an advantage over SpaceX, as Elon's enemies are going to SpaceX a hard time sooner or later..

**Cathie Wood** sold 70,252 shares of RKLB in ARKQ and ARKX fund. What can I say? üöÄ

**Jim Cramer** does NOT recommend buying. On Nov 24 last year: ""'It's Not A Bad Company By Any Means, But It Is Up 305%'."". The stock was $24 back then. It went up 38% to hit all time high $33.34 on Jan 24, and has corrected nearly 20% since then. üöÄ

**Investor community:** r/RKLB dip buyers are in no rush to cash out. Most of them are long term HOLDers. They are really nice people and they hate wsb fomo. They don't want RKLB to be a meme stock, but who can stop the rocket when it decides to go up? üöÄ

**Technical analysis**: I have never seen a stock battling major resistance so many time so hard. Since January, RKLB has challenged and rejected by $30 eight times, each time with higher lows. A weak-ass stock doesn't challenge major resistance so rigorously. While it has been frustrating for bulls, the stronger the resistance, the stronger the support it becomes after break out.

# Price Target

With SpaceX valued at 350 billion in **private market**, Rocket Lab 12.3 billion market cap is chump change. I expect Rocket Lab to deliver Neutron, and continue its track record of engineering excellence. **A conservative 1/10 valuation of SpaceX would place RKLB at 35 billion, or $78 per share.** But I expect the share price to go much higher than that after Neutron hit the market and everyone realizes what a genius üöÄ it is.

Bears can bash me with their price-to-sales ratio and other financial metrics. That's not how you price new technology, trend, and sentiment üöÄüöÄüöÄ. Just because it's up 700% from rock bottom doesn't mean it's too late. Good stocks go up and they keep going up. Get used to averaging up.

Why Estimates For NVIDIA's Q4 Revenue Could Be Dead Wrong: The Case for NVIDIA's Next Blowout Report,"TL;DR: Estimating NVIDIA's Q4 FY2025\* revenue from the capex of its four largest customers using linear regression results in an estimated revenue that is significantly higher than Wall Street's expectations.

*\*Note: Although it may sound confusing, NVIDIA is in fiscal year 2025 and will report its* [*Q4 FY2025 results on February 26, 2025*](https://investor.nvidia.com/events-and-presentations/events-and-presentations/default.aspx)*.*

*This is the author‚Äôs opinion only, not financial advice, and is intended for entertainment purposes only. The author holds a beneficial long position in NVIDIA Corporation. The author receives no compensation for writing this article and has no business relationship with any of the companies mentioned. The following analysis has been carefully conducted, but numbers or calculations may be incorrect, leading to potentially incorrect results.*

NVIDIA will report its¬†Q4 FY2025 financial results on February 26. The consensus estimate for NVIDIA's Q4 revenue is¬†[$38.13 billion](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/analysis/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANOTJUpcAKXWdLKLCN4HDOw3xKM2mpDinXbx-3Ru72Xm5RtzQ8Qf0ruVaAPw61jJOwPbZHkqX9X2SRQvZJqafxEFMyTmQoFXdmxWLKJ-26YBEwQoOy5EcgpCEHOlmOzeyyZXGeSD-90RiaVAj_H8nFt0DtbA37mKFQUC-eGlN5tA). In the past two weeks, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, NVIDIA's largest customers, have reported earnings.¬†[One of the biggest headlines](https://www.ft.com/content/634b7ec5-10c3-44d3-ae49-2a5b9ad566fa)¬†was the announcement that these four companies plan to spend approximately $320 billion in capital expenditures (capex) through 2025:

|Year|Meta|Alphabet|Microsoft|Amazon|Sum|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2024 ($bn)|39.2|52.6|75.6|77.8|245.2|
|2025 (planned, $bn)|65.0|75.0|80.0|100.0|320.0|

Much less attention was paid to the significant increase in capital expenditures by these companies last quarter:

|Category|Meta|Alphabet|Microsoft|Amazon|Sum|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Last quarter reported ($bn)|14.425|14.276|15.804|27.834|72.339|
|Previous quarter ($bn)|8.258|13.061|14.923|22.620|58.862|
|Change from previous quarter|\+74.7%|\+9.3%|\+5.9%|\+23.1%|\+22.90%|

Since these 4 companies are the largest buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs, it makes sense to examine a correlation between these companies' quarterly capex and NVIDIA's quarterly revenue. For the last 7 quarters, we get a strong correlation coefficient of 0.95 (Pearson correlation). Now, if we use linear regression to estimate NVIDIA's revenue for the yet-to-be-reported Q4 2025 based on this data, we get quarterly revenue of $49.265 billion, which is more than $10 billion above the consensus analyst estimate.

https://preview.redd.it/fuwtgc4iv9ie1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=477315081203fddfa64c4744f2429c371c4a8041

Of course, NVIDIA's GPUs account for only a portion of these 4 companies' reported capex. However, given the recent disappointing results from NVIDIA's competitor AMD, that portion may have increased. It could also be that a lot of datacenters have been built now and these costs were already incurred in previous quarters, leaving more capex for NVIDIA's GPUs - and the newly built datacenters should now have plenty of room for the upcoming Blackwell generation. Of course, companies like Alphabet are also building their own AI chips, but¬†they are much less cost-effective¬†than NVIDIA's Hopper generation and especially the upcoming Blackwell generation. Or as¬†[Amazon CEO Andy Jassy put it on an analyst call last week](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-price-87ccceac?mod=RTA): ""*most AI compute has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future.*"" All in all, one could assume that the share of capex from these 4 companies going to NVIDIA may have even increased in the last quarter.

In addition, there are other major buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs: xAI, for example, has also purchased tens of thousands of NVIDIA's GPUs and built the massive supercomputer¬†[Colossus with 100,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/spectrum-x-ethernet-networking-xai-colossus). Another massive buyer of NVIDIA's GPUs has just formed with Project Stargate, which plans to invest a staggering¬†[$500 billion in new AI infrastructure](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/)¬†over the next four years. All of this should continue to be a strong wind in NVIDIA's sails.

My positions: 200 NVIDIA shares.

NKE Potential High Reward Setup with full analysis and position.,"**MONDAY UPDATE**: Monday closed at day high, above Friday's high, block trades shows institutional support the battle of 70 has clearly established it as strong accumulation support, this should gap up nicely tmr as analysts identify the trade blocks and feel more confident of entering position; could rally 2 days in a row, if we hit 74 tmr, id expect a squeeze to around 77-78, that will probably be my exit.

Position update, the 1200 calls gone up by 25% or about 20k unrealized gain, i will hold it through for a 10 bagger, also added 500 calls for this friday at 73 strike for 0.24, may exit this on Wednesday or a second impulse move regardless if it hits 78 price target or not; il be happy with hitting 75 which is the POC for the past few months.

**TUESDAY UPDATE:** right on cue we had battle of 71.5 today, bullish price action is very nice, typical consolidation, stop loss should be adjusted to 70 ish, tmr is very crucial as now the price retraced back to value low, if Wednesday we see strong volume heading back into the 72-78 range, we are in play for a surge as traders now have confirmation last friday's sell off is over reaction; the main target is 75 where POC lies, depending on if we see a strong squeeze, this will be a good level to exit, otherwise scale out between 76, 77 and 78 for this week; if the test low establishes a clear floor, this could be the rally that propels nike to 82 in couple of weeks where the daily 200EMA sits at.

**WEDNESDAY UPDATE:** very strong bullish price action, consolidation at 72.5 which is the 30-min 200EMA, the short sellers came in 72.25 with large blocks, but got bought up easy, set up looking good for momentum traders to join in, tmr should be a nice gap up, as we have fully invalidated last friday's selloff, so the quick sell off range last thursday should have very little resistance, the move could be quick. Taking half of the table at gap up, likely targeting 75 for a 10 bagger, then at 77 is my best case scenario to fully exit weekly calls.

**THURSDAY UPDATE:**¬†hoping to see a break of 73 overnight but it didnt happen, sold at open for 0.65 at 73 first short entry, cost basis 0.21, nice little 300% gain, bought in again for 0.2 at pull back to 15 minute 200EMA, held same amount of original position with 200% profit taken and saved; sold all at the end for 0.8 for another 400% gain; in total ended the day with a 7 bagger; keeping next week's 50k 74C position acquired last friday over the weekend currently at 155k, with 77-78 price target this thing will return 500k; using 30% of winning from weekly calls bought 25k worth of 73 put at 0.3 for risk adjustment as are at a crossroad of 1hr resistance, gonna end the day early and shower. Added more lotto calls at 75 and 76 small positions.

**FRIDAY UPDATE:** sold 73 puts at opening hours for 0.65 that bought for 0.3, did not take new positions for the rest of the day, as again we did not break the resistance overnight, so yesterday's high is the ranging target, seems like this week the market wants to stay building tension. Target for next week is 76.5 and 77.8, 73 should now be the floor and bullish pattern is intact.

**NEXT MONDAY UPDATE:** we have breakout with index and relative strength with Dow very nice, took 50% profit for 10 bagger, now its lotto time, bought 150 puts for intraday hedge, out for 3k profit, the action is strong (will post position screenshot if people actually wants proof). Signing off early to take the wife out, good profit for 2 weeks work, some buddies jumped on the ship, it was good ride, good luck to you all.

**NEXT MONDAY UPDATE 2**: Hit my price target, out of the positions for a nice little 500k gain. Bought protective puts to hedge (i also have long NKE positions), this week max pain is between 73 and 75, slight pullback is possible as we are near 1.5 SD of VWAP for multiple key time frames. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I believe NKE currently presents a wonderful potentially 10 bagger opportunity with a high likelihood of seeing a short squeeze in the coming weeks; we could see the price go to 82 from 68 (extreme case), which is a 20% gain on stock.

200-month EMA support

Basic long term support level for reference, at this level institutional actors are active as it provides clear technical reference. We are only in the first week of the month so it is left to be said if we may close above it or not.

2. Analysis of the Price Action & Technical Setup

https://preview.redd.it/wtc29ulet9ie1.png?width=1555&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a0e09bc3a6ebbf0d63d7e58a0f41027c6a2d703

**- (Neutral Signal) Volume Profile Analysis:**¬†currently we have a break below the 6 months volume profile value low, in English this means we had a breakout to the downside; as you may know, most breakouts fail and lead to strong reversals (ie. bull/bear traps). so now we should be asking ""hmmm does this feel like a true breakout?"" Nevertheless the breakdown means major funds will be alerted as most funds have protocols on alerts of new lows, so more eyes are now assessing the situation and readying to play.

**- (Neutral Signal) Extreme Volume:**¬†the volume on Friday is comparable to earnings volume, which is almost 3 times the average volume; this is quite significant, the likely explanation is that since the price made new low, it triggers many natural stop losses for the entirety of the last 6 months. This effectively has shaken out near all ""weak hands"" in the entire range. The abnormal volume could signal capitulation and selling climax (see section on darkpool orders for whether the selling is controlled or panic).

**- (Buying Signal) Dark Pool Accumulation:**¬†go to 5 seconds time frame if you can, and inspect the order blocks during the day and especially near close, you will see huge blocks at 69.50 69.00 68.70, perfect whole numbers of large size typically signal dark pool blocks, the planned manner with a tightening range is a classic bottom fishing behaviour, it generally means that the buy side is taking advantage of the extreme selling by ""letting the price to come to them"" in a controlled way.

**- (Buying Signal) VWAP:**¬†price settled nicely on Friday right on -2 SD VWAP (6-months anchor from the June 2024 quarter), which is a classic technical level for mean reversion players to enter.

**- (Buying Signal) RSI:**¬†1-hr and 4 hr RSI are at extremely oversold levels, this coupled with -2 SD VWAP shows a powerful signal for buying.

https://preview.redd.it/u7ezp41gt9ie1.png?width=1427&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a64d6e49b7e6b18e728e10618f78346b726cb62

**- (Buying Signal) Clean Technical Low:**¬†the price broke below 6-months low, actually it broke 5 year low as it is only higher than the covid panic crash; at this new low, it provides an intuitive an natural area for short sellers to cover. This along with the fact that the price is at -2 SD VWAP, means we have a confluence of buying interest from mean aversion long traders, value investors, and short seller covers.

https://preview.redd.it/45kh0e5ht9ie1.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8c0b96c38739f8c6eae5652650a509b6b533ef7

\- (Buying Signal) Put/Call Interest: the put call interest for next week has a singular peak at 70 strike, and the ratio is 20 to 1, this is HIGHLY significant as naturally the 70 is the nice and clean floor for the range and put sellers understandable congregate at that level. As the price drops near 70, the short put will be increasing in value, and the put seller option makers will delta hedge by shorting the stock, at 70 these put sellers will have effectively completed there delta hedge, so they will no longer be compelled to do more selling (you should paste this to an AI chatbot for clarification as it can explain the concept in detail). The put sellers will not wish to sell the stock even lower as that would mean there puts will be exercised and they would rather the put be expired worthless.

If you inspect the price action on Friday, it is clear that the selling pressure sits EXACTLY at 70 (ie. where the buying attempts failed and the selling pressure brought the price down to 68.6).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3. Analysis on Trader Category & Trade Psychology

This section outlines the expected psychology and positioning of the major players in the market.

\- Institutional Players: Clean technical level, alerted of the new low and is aware of the nice -2 SD value area. Could be instructed to rebalance or rotate over the weekend. The technical indicators support oversold status on multiple time frames.

\- Value / Long Term Investor: the new low provides a natural place to average down for players who have more tolerance for volatility and longer time horizon.

\- Hedge Fund / Option Makers: Put sellers have finished the delta hedge, and no need to short the stock more since it is below 70; if the price rises, these put sellers will have to cover their hedge position by buying the stock back. This accelerates as we break 70 and above.

\- Short Sellers: the new low provides a natural place to cover the short positions without feeling like you missed out; short sellers also compete with each other who can close the position at the best price, as being late means you have to cover high.

\- Retail: most likely their stop losses have been taken out by the breakdown, and now they have forced capitulation. This means selling pressure has been reduced dramatically. Many people are waiting for 65, but the interest at this level is simply too obvious, and the market may have no interesting in letting the obvious deals occur. It could as well bottom at 68, and reverse, leading to FOMO of those prospect longs to buy back higher.

**All in all, we have the possibility of an interesting confluence of multiple parties nearly all aligned for ""Buying"" - this means strong and quick moves to the upside.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4. Prediction

First few days next week we will likely see:

\- Battle of 69 & 70: the buy side is setting a controlled bottom at 69, the initial sellers at 70 are ""option makers"" who are not yet completed delta hedging their short put; if 70 is breached and holds, then those put sellers switches from sell side to buy side, as now they must cover their short positions. We Could see in the open a quick test of 69 as the support, if it is brough up, we will test 70.

\- Battle of 71.5: this is the volume profile value low, if the resistance is strong and LOTS of sellers jump in, this actually validates the breakdown, as the old range is rejected; so this will likely be the first major hurdle. If this breaks then we likely see a retracement from 72.5 (-1 SD VWAP) to 71.5, if 71.5 becomes support, then we likely go straight to the POC at 75 with little resistance.

\- Gap to 75: the above situations might occur on monday or tuesday, then if all goes well 75 could be a nice place to gap up to overnight, then the spring is loaded and we move quick to VWAP at 77.5, potentially overshooting to 78.

\- Consolidation at 78: this is the first level where profit takers should emerge, could be a nice place to take short term positions off the table.

\- Burst to 81-82: It is also possible for the spring move to send the price to the +1 SD VWAP level, which incidentally is also the 200-day EMA, this provides a super natural resistance and a great place to profit take all the position.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

5. Gameplan

\- If you enter below 70, set your stop loss at 68, and watch 70 and 71.5 closely. The price should bounce between 69 and 71.5 as the battle plays out, if 71.5 is breached, move your stop loss to 70. Now you are in guaranteed profit.

\- If you enter later, set your entry near 71.5 after the successful breach, the price should retest that level to validate the fact that the volume profile range is still in play, set your stop loss at 70.

\- If we have breached 71.5 then a reversal is almost inevitable as the shorts on Friday are absolutely trapped and shorts from 78 to 72 are getting nervous, and potentially looking to cover. Now you should be considering exit strategies at 75, 78 and 81.

\- For call buyers i recommend buying some 74C expiring in 2-3 weeks, as most short squeezes complete in 4-10 trading days. You could also consider buy weekly put at 70 when the price tests 71.5 as a hedge for continued breakdown.

\- If all goes well, your 74C could be netting 5 to 10 to 20 times return (depending on the degree of the squeeze).

I hope someone finds this post interesting, good luck boy!

DD: Why I‚Äôm All In $NBIS,"Alright degenerates, let‚Äôs talk about NBIS‚Äîthe AI infrastructure company that Wall Street has been sleeping on but might be gearing up for a major post-earnings rip.

This company spun out of Yandex, but thanks to all the geopolitical drama, a lot of people still don‚Äôt know what it actually is. TL;DR: It‚Äôs basically Russia‚Äôs ex-Google Cloud, now reborn as an independent AI infrastructure company based in the Netherlands. They‚Äôre competing in the high-performance AI cloud space alongside CoreWeave, AWS, and Azure‚Äîexcept they‚Äôre still valued like some no-name SPAC trash.

Now, let‚Äôs get into the bull case.

Why NBIS is Undervalued

1. Earnings & Growth
	‚Ä¢	Revenue for Q3 2024: $43.3M (up 766% YoY)
	‚Ä¢	Annualized Run-Rate (ARR): $120M+ as of September 2024
	‚Ä¢	Guidance for 2025: Expecting $750M-$1B in revenue
	‚Ä¢	6x‚Äì8x revenue multiple (compared to CoreWeave‚Äôs 14.5x)

Wall Street is still pricing NBIS like a small-cap while it‚Äôs already scaling revenues like a top AI infrastructure player.

2. $700M in Fresh Funding
	‚Ä¢	December 2024: Raised $700M in a private placement from Accel, NVIDIA, and Orbis Investments at $21/share
	‚Ä¢	Well-funded to scale their massive GPU clusters, eliminating AI capex concerns

DeepSeek‚Äôs AI bubble pop made investors scared of AI infrastructure capex, but NBIS has $2.2B in cash and doesn‚Äôt need to burn another $10B to stay competitive.

3. Goldman Sachs Coverage Incoming?
	‚Ä¢	Goldman handled their PIPE deal and was expected to initiate coverage in January, but they might be waiting until earnings (Feb 20) or until PIPE investors file
	‚Ä¢	Once they drop coverage, expect institutional inflows

If Goldman drops a buy rating and earnings are strong, this thing is sending.

4. CoreWeave Valuation Peg
	‚Ä¢	CoreWeave is now valued at $29B (14.5x revenue multiple)
	‚Ä¢	NBIS is currently trading at 6-8x revenue, well below CoreWeave
	‚Ä¢	If we apply a 14.5x multiple, NBIS should be worth $15B+ today
	‚Ä¢	Current implied valuation? Sub-$9B

At a fair valuation of 14.5x sales, NBIS should be worth $60+ right now.

5. Data Center Expansion = More GPUs

NBIS is investing $1B+ in AI infrastructure across Europe and the US:
	‚Ä¢	Finland: Expanding to 75MW, housing 60,000 GPUs
	‚Ä¢	Paris: New GPU cluster featuring NVIDIA H200 Tensor Cores
	‚Ä¢	Kansas City: Launching new GPU cluster in Q1 2025, expanding to 40MW (~35,000 GPUs)

The Setup: Feb 20 Earnings = The Catalyst
	‚Ä¢	Goldman coverage likely post-earnings
	‚Ä¢	Guidance expected to confirm 2025 $750M-$1B revenue
	‚Ä¢	Market still clueless about their scale

If earnings confirm continued growth and institutional coverage hits, we could see a massive repricing.

Conclusion: This Is a Classic Asymmetric Bet

At 6-8x sales, NBIS is still undervalued for an AI infrastructure company growing 700% YoY. CoreWeave is already valued at 14.5x revenue, and NBIS should be worth at least $60+ today.

Feb 20 earnings + Goldman coverage = massive upside.

This isn‚Äôt financial advice, but I just bought a metric ton of shares.

See you at $120."
üöÄ HAS (Hasbro) is About to Move! üöÄ,"Disclaimer: I'm just a person on the internet. I have been practicing tracking dark pool and large block orders on OpenBB and Whale Stream and using it to signal moves when the open interest on a stock lines up for it. Also, I got 3 HAS 2/21 $61 call contracts at open, so I am totally biased. Still, this is why I bought them, and the best time to get in is actually soon, not when I bought them. But please take responsibility for your own decisions, and you should double check everything I'm pointing out on your own. I am not a financial advisor.

HAS stock was around $68 in mid-December and has dropped to around $59 as of today. But the recent action strongly suggests a major move is coming‚Äîand soon.

The Bullish Signals:
üìå Massive Dark Pool Order
On Feb. 5, a $16 million dark pool trade (270k shares) went through at $58.90 at 3:53 PM. The stock shot up immediately afterward at open. This looks like a buy, and big-money buys often precede major moves. Whale trades like this are usually done after hours, and in the past 1 year period there was not a single other example of a trade $15m or greater during market hours (I checked using the historical search function of Whale Stream), everything else was 4pm or later, and I know 7 minutes doesn't seem like an important difference, but the order gets processed in a completely different way and after hours orders take a lot longer for the stock price to react to. So, someone wanted to buy desperately enough to push it through in the lit market to get their order filled quickly.

üìå Huge Options Bets on Feb. 5
Also on Feb. 5, someone dropped serious money on:

8,000 contracts of 2/21 $60 calls
8,000 contracts of 2/21 $67.50 calls
This is key: This double order pattern (near the money & further OTM) is a known indicator of someone betting big ahead of news.

üìå Feb. 6 (Today) - All That Volume Converted
Today, nearly all of that volume has converted into open interest. The options chain is now extremely bullish (it already looked pretty good before), signaling a big move ahead.

üìå Earnings Are Coming - Feb. 20 (Before Open)
Expectations are low, and HAS has crushed estimates for the last three earnings reports. If history repeats, a strong beat could send this flying.

üìå Technical Setup: Retest $58.90 Before the Move Up

After a large buy, it's common for a stock to pull back as traders take profits.
The $58.90 dark pool level should act as support.
HAS is on its way down for the retest‚Äîonce it touches, it should rocket back up.

üìå Price Targets?

Expecting a move above $60 soon
Potential for $67.50+ around earnings

üìå Short Interest? Not Huge, But There

It isn't as crazy as an unmentionable stock loved by kitties everywhere (you know which one, and it's at 7.9% short interest), but 3.3% is still notable, and those shorts will have to cover once HAS makes its move, adding more upward pressure.

TL;DR:
üî• HAS is primed to move up. It will likely retest $58.90 first before taking off. The 2/21 calls suggest someone knows something, and the huge dark pool buy supports this thesis. Earnings on Feb. 20 could be the final catalyst.

üöÄ Watch for the $58.90 touch‚Äîonce it holds, this thing is going UP."
BULLISH on CLSK's Earnings Today 2/6/25,"Disclosure: \~$32k in CLSK calls and \~$100k in CLSK shares between Schwab and RH accounts.

CleanSpark (CLSK) is the most heavily suppressed stock in the BTC mining industry. It has a 28% short interest due to covered callers shorting the stock. I ran numbers based on prior financials and accounted for appreciation of BTC assets based on 12/31/2024 price of $93.6k per BTC. CLSK now holds over 10,000 BTC and three days ago reported expanding beyond 40 exahash (meaning still on track to reach 50 exahash goal by H1 2025).

In December, they acquired a $650M zero interest convertible note to pay for BTC mining hardware and buy back 11.76M shares. This note was made possible under the new FASB rule. Accounting for the no interest loan, hardware depreciation, lower share count, higher income, and higher asset value, I consider CLSK likely to beat -0.16 EPS projections and actually report positive EPS. Based on ability to get financing, beat expectations, and make tons of money in BTC, I'm hoping the market takes note.

Hopefully, I'm right about this :')

DD: Big Bear AI ($BBAI) - palantir 2.0,"I‚Äôm looking for the regardedest, lowest, humblest of you to confirm the way.

* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when ""[geneman7](https://www.reddit.com/user/geneman7/)"" said PLTR bumpy revenues weren‚Äôt a concern (2022).
* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when ""[geneman7](https://www.reddit.com/user/geneman7/)"" said get into Bitcoin before the wall street wave (2017).
* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when ""[geneman7](https://www.reddit.com/user/geneman7/)"" said Tesla revenues were about to go parabolic (2017).

It‚Äôs true when they say Bears sound smart at parties, but the bulls make money. Ironically in Big Bear AI the bears will eventually become bulls.

So, fellow idiots, I think we have another winner and PLTR 2.0. Time to get hyped.

Big Bear AI ($BBAI): 1.8b market cap - Float 173M Short 37.4M = 21.6% SI

BBAI started as a SPAC in 2021 and besides a few spikes it was only downward trajectory. Until now, a huge spike in stock price and currently holds above the 52wk high.

Strengths:

* Innovative Technology: BBAI leverages advanced AI and machine learning capabilities to transform complex data into actionable insights, enhancing decision-making processes across various industries.
* Diverse Client Base: The company serves multiple sectors, including defense, healthcare, and finance, diversifying its revenue streams and reducing dependence on any single market.
* Established Government Contracts:¬†[BigBear.ai](http://bigbear.ai/)¬†has secured significant contracts with federal government agencies, providing a stable revenue stream and long-term growth potential.
* Strategic Acquisitions: The acquisition of Pangiam in February 2024 expanded BigBear.ai's capabilities and market presence, particularly in security and intelligence solutions.

Weaknesses:

* Financial Challenges: As of the third quarter of 2024,¬†[BigBear.ai](http://bigbear.ai/)¬†reported an accumulated deficit of $462 million, with operating cash flow remaining negative over recent years.

Now the spicy stuff:

**- Ties to Trump administration**

New CEO Kevin McAleenan is best known for his role as the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). McAleenan also was the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

Words of Trump himself:¬†*‚ÄúI will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places in which they came,‚Äù*¬†Guess which company will benefit of this.

**- Pangiam acquisition = Vision AI - CHECK THEIR WEBSITE and what they are doing**

Vision AI is increasingly being used in border control

TLDR:

My bet is BBAI has a greater than 50% chance for growth reacceleration. Government contracts will start flowing in and airports will adopt BBAI's AI software completely.

Seeing Palantir at a 230b valuation makes me think BBAI is just getting started

None of this is financial advice. I may or may not know what I‚Äôm doing.

CLSK Earnings Today and What Follows,"On 11/24/24, I called MSTR top at $422 and it dipped. From 11/8/24 to 11/21/24, I bought IREN expecting an HPC-AI update. It rallied 60% to $15.39 in a week. On 11/15/24, I bought SMCI believing extension approval likely. It rallied 138% to $44.16. With earnings tomorrow, Bitcoin miner CLSK is up next.

Don't be surprised if CLSK beats earnings, stays on track for 50 exahash by H1 2025, and further builds shareholder value with higher projected BTC per share. While RIOT and MARA copy MSTR using convertible notes buying Bitcoin at \~$100k, CLSK invested in itself using their $650M note to instead buy back shares and fund growth. 2 days ago, CLSK announced surpassing 40 exahash. Despite 28% shorts and negative EPS projections, CLSK may make some serious noise on wall street as shorts learn the hard way not to be greedy. If you're bullish on Bitcoin, CLSK assets and profits are going HIGHER this year too. If it matters, last year CLSK rallied HARD after beating earnings early February 2024 too.

If one invests like everyone else, one will get the same gains as everyone else. I am beyond excited to see what's coming for CLSK shareholders and Bitcoin holders in the years to come. I'm ready CLSK.

Not financial advice. Do your own research.

Great Time to Scoop up Some AMD!,"I believe the market is overreacting to AMD Q4 earnings, representing a great time to add some shares. Let's get into it.

**Q4 Highlights -**

* Revenue of $7,658 billion, 24% increase YoY.
* Gross Profit of $3,882, 33% increase YoY.
* Increased Gross Margin of 51%.
* Operating Income of $871 million, 155% increase YoY.
* Data Center segment revenue of $3.9 billion, 69% increase YoY.

**Full Year Financial Highlights 2024 -**

* Revenue of $25,785 billion, 14% increase.
* Gross Profit of $12,725 billion, 22% increase.
* Net Income of $1,641, 92% increase.
* Data Center revenue of $12,6 billion, 94% increase.
* Client segment revenue of $7.1 billion, 52% increase.

**My Thoughts & Interpretation of Q4 -** Looking at these numbers, they all seem pretty great. AMD posted a record year in just about every category. They continue to secure deals like the ones made with IBM in November, and with Dell in January. They also continue to innovate with new product releases in order to stay competitive. Investors simply got spooked because of the revenue miss for data centers and lower than expected GPU sales. Is this enough cause for concern? I think not. I find it ridiculous that they experienced 69% growth YoY for Q4 data center revenue, and still got wrecked after earnings, with a 94% increase in the segment for the entire year! The way I see it, they are demonstrating their ability to capture market share. Not to mention they posted record revenue in the client segment. They gave strong guidance, expecting revenue for Q1 2025 of $7.1 billion, which would be 30% YoY growth. This is all bullish to me.

**Key Financial Metrics -** Gross profit as a percentage of sales has been trending upwards for years, now sitting at 53%. This signifies good management and increasing operational efficiency. They have a very low FWD PEG of .57 and FWD P/B ratio of 3.14 representing undervaluation. 

**Average 5-Year Growth Rates -** Revenue Growth = 33.91%. Net Income = 36.92%. EBITDA Growth = 65.27%. FCF Per Share = 68.86%. Working Capital = 44.21%.

**Conclusion -** I think this is a great company that is simply unloved by the market currently. They have done nothing but demonstrate their ability to innovate and compete over the years. This is a trend that I do not see slowing down. The most recent dip presents a great buy opportunity as the price will correct eventually. **At a price per share of $111, I think AMD trades at a bargain considering future growth and the overall potential of the company. $200+ is on the horizon.** \*Que Advanced Money Destroyer jokes\*

**Thesis: Why You Should Go Bullish on PayPal Right Now**,"Let‚Äôs talk about why jumping on PayPal (PYPL) is a no-brainer as of February 5, 2025.

1. **Totally Oversold**: PayPal‚Äôs stock has taken a hit lately, and it‚Äôs trading at a discount. When the market overreacts and pushes the price down, that‚Äôs a prime chance for a bounce back. Think of this as buying low before it starts to soar!

2. **Earnings Report was Fire**: PayPal just dropped some impressive earnings, showing solid revenue growth and profitability. This kind of performance usually gets investors hyped and sets the stage for a rally. If people realize how strong the fundamentals are, they‚Äôll start buying up shares.

3. **Massive $15 Billion Buyback**: PayPal just announced a huge $15 billion share buyback. What does this mean? Fewer shares means higher earnings per share (EPS), which is like throwing gasoline on the fire! It shows that the management is all-in on boosting shareholder value, and that‚Äôs usually a recipe for price appreciation."
Remember $PAA last year? It‚Äôs back.,"Good evening degens. About ten months ago, Plains All American Pipeline had some great DD posted here about call options and IV in the midstream space. 
 
Some key themes were around a potential Trump presidency and favorable domestic drilling policy. The implied moves on companies like this are low because they pay out large quarterly dividends. 

In Q1 of 2024 there was a sell off after the ex-dividend date followed by a rip in price that topped in April before the 4/31 ex-div date. I made some good money on that rip (posted above). A big reason why the stock price shot up was because of the gamma squeeze caused by option buying from this sub. When market makers become overexposed by selling call options, they have to hedge by buying the underlying security. That caused a surge in share price that tripled my money in a week and a half. 

This time around, we need to ape into calls with shorter duration. I‚Äôve targeted 3/21/25 expiration calls with $20 strike. This allows us to take advantage of the price appreciation over the next six weeks without worrying about the stock selling off after the next ex-dividend date on April 31st. 

Target prices issued in the past month peg the stock from $19 - 24 per share. It‚Äôs my belief given rhetoric on domestic oil production and tariffs that this stock will move towards the upper end of this range in the coming months. 

Cost basis on $20 strike 3/21/25 exp options are about 0.70 right now. That means the market is pricing in a stock price of 20.70 a share in six weeks, a mere 3% premium on the current price. I have strong conviction the stock will move above $21 next couple weeks. If that happens, these calls will double in value. If we get a sustained move towards $22, this would be a 3x. 

Let‚Äôs gamma squeeze these market makers again. Whether you‚Äôre a Trump Guy or not, least we can do is capitalize on his policies to make some money. "
NVO earnings,"Hey lads, sorry i wish i could have shared a nice DD but i'm bad with ChatGPT.

So let's do this.
NVO will announce earnings tomorrow before the market openning and i think it's time to ride the tiger.

There is several indicator that shows how hard the rocket will go.

1) The stock is underevaluated, they are pioneer in the fat folk treatment with their best seller drug Ozempic. When people discovered that this medicine targeted at diabetus people could reduce grease from obese ones, every fat people tried to get a hand on the drug. Making the stock rise to 146$.

2) Since the competition race oppened. Eli Lilly company tried to steal the lion's share. So they try to make a drug wich seems very good, but can we trust a laboratory that are known to go in court for Bad usage of the drugs leading to people getting health issues?
I dont think so.

3) The tanking of NVO stock was an overreaction.
The investing people were expecting a 25% grease beating on fat people, but the study showed that it was ""only"" 22.7% tallow cut.
So everyone panicked and decide to make the stock tonk. So no real reason to assassinate a company.

3) The New NVO study from 23 january showed that the Wegovy drug is finally outperforming the expectation and is about to rock the market. But still, the stock went from 78$ to 90$ and plunged again to 81$ for no real reason.

4) The technical analysis say 2 things. The gap from 81 to 86 has been filled. So the prophecy of ""you have to fill gaps"" is fulfilled.

And there is another gap, from 102$ to 89$.
So if the gap filling mythology is right. We have to fill it with a good catalyst.

And what better catalyst than good earnings? None.

That's why i call for Nostradamus wisdom and say that in febuary, the stock will be above 102$.

So right now i'm 100% sure that the stock will outperform and we're on the reversal point from pasta eating to eating in a Lamborghini stock.

If you want to ride with me to Valhalla, join the train and eat the lambo.

May poor people become rich from this stock, so they gan grow big and use the Wegovy drug to lose the fat and become more rich with the sell of the drugs. 

The end.

Position here. 1/3 of my whole wallet."
The market has not accurately priced in Recursion Pharmaceuticals' (RXRX) upcoming drug presentation.,"Recursion Pharmacueticals is biotech company that claims they can use AI to develop drugs for less money, faster.  They are presenting a late breaking¬†science¬†oral¬†abstract session on REC-994 at the International Stroke Conference tomorrow.  For those of you who (like me) didn't know what late breaking¬†science¬†oral¬†abstract existed before you just read it, it's important drug information that came out recently.  REC-994 is their flagship drug, and a key indicator of whether or not their claims are true or not.  Biotech is notorious for its insane volatility, and when you add potentially revolutionizing how pharma works into the mix, it's only going to get even more volatile.  I believe that the market has not accurately price this in.  At the current prices, a 7$ put and 8$ call strangle would [break even at 8.35 and 6.65](http://opcalc.com/4lj).  RXRX has moved further than that on zero news whatsoever, much less important drug results. Moreover, the IV is hovering within its usual range.  So why has the market not priced this in?  I have two possible explanations:

1. I'm regarded.

2. The market doesn't know recursion is going to make this presentation.  There has been no news on the topic whatsoever, and the only reason I know about it is because it was a footnote  on the [17th slide of their JP Morgan healthcare conference presentation](https://ir.recursion.com/static-files/0c96b530-a709-4d13-849c-5394d8571b3f).  In the actual presentation they didn't mention this, so it's entirely possible most people just missed it.  Recursion is also [not mentioned by name on the stroke conference's website](https://professional.heart.org/en/meetings/international-stroke-conference/programming/late-breaking-science), so you need to know that REC 994 is recursion's drug.  

3. I'm regarded.

I hold both $PLTR Palantir and $BB Blackberry. Why I'm confident Blackberry will be the next Palantir,"Ah yes, I'll say it first, ""oh look, another BlackBerry thread, these always come up once every year and nothing ever happens"" or ""been holding BBags since $15"". Well, I've been holding onto my BBags for 4 years (just as I have with Palantir) - you can check my posting history for receipts - and I'm holding for glory.

Back to the comparison. Once upon a time, Palantir was building an operating system called Foundry that Wallstreet and paperhands collectively decided could be a worthless pipedream and dropped it back to and below it's original DPO price to $6 and change.

Fast forward to today and the stock is $100 and you have Dr. Alex Karp saying this:

***‚ÄúFor the first time people want to partner with us, it used to be partnership meetings where it was a complete waste of time and BS just so they can say they met with us like high school dating for nerds‚Ä¶now, I have real partnership discussions because a lot of these people in verticals have to deliver and are under a lot of pressure and know how good our products are‚Äù. - Alex Karp***

\----------------

Now lets compare this to BlackBerry with a short little history lesson. Okay, a super short  history lesson. Forget their phones ever existed - they acquired a company called QNX in 2010 and have since been the de facto **OPERATING SYSTEM** for most cars not named Tesla and are in 24/25 EV's that are becoming increasingly complex and data driven (they also have a significant presence in the growing medical devices field and soon to be robotics field as well, which are gravy on top of the cherry).

Palantir was head banging away 20+ years to get their operating system to be future proof (okay, admittedly I don't know if it actually took them 20 years to develop Foundry, but lets go with that) and similarly, BlackBerry has been doing the same with QNX.

Now lets read a couple quotes from the BlackBerry team about QNX.

Quote #1:  
***The moat -- the competitive moat around this QNX business continues to remain very deep.***

***And to John's point, if anything, we're in a fairly strong position here that OEMs are coming to us and asking us to do more. - Tim Foote, Chief Financial Officer***

Quote #2:  
***Customers are now coming to QNX for its proven safety and security credentials, which are essential in today's market. - John Chen, Former CEO***

\-----------------

Okay, now it's time for you to do some brain work and think this thought through carefully. Do you think an operating system that makes your car and whatever future car(s) you're going to buy (unless you buy a Tesla) functional and is critical for safety, is worth only 3.71 billion dollars?

What if I told you that this operating system could also be the foundation for medical devices that'll keep you alive after your 10th trip to Vegas or Thailand? Or what if I told you that it could be integral to making sure that your robot housemaid isn't stealing your girlfriend/wife/boyfriend?

The TLDR of all of this is:

Would you rather buy a McD's burger for $4 or a single share of an operating system that hasn't yet been discovered as the most secure operating system for cars and in the future, robotics and medical devices?

Short Idea (w/ Position) - Sprout Farmers Market (Ticker: SFM),"**Position**: Posting again, with position ($15k short bet) as requested by Moderator (thank you for your support):

**Update** **#1** \- The Mexico tariffs are supposedly delayed by a month, which was the main catalyst here

**Idea**: Hear me out, with the new Trump tariffs, produce from Mexico (which is the majority of American produce) will be tariffed 25%, heavily increasing the cost of produce.

Sprouts is on a massive run (up 200% year-over-year) selling expensive produce to consumers. If the Trump tariffs stand, produce imported from Mexico will cost 25-30% more, and this is the main cost that Sprouts has, their product. The company has performed incredibly well on increased margins, but how well will these margins hold up when they're trying not to increase the cost of their goods to consumers by 25-30% immediately against last week.

Their margins could shrink substantially, as consumers push back on 30% increases to Produce, and the 200% stock run could evaporate with deep downside. These are the results that have already brought a massive upswing:

https://preview.redd.it/2m8mfw2iyxge1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=a992c95ecb84235c9cca437b2fcca68563c42ae9

This compares to other stocks like Ford, GM, Nutrien which are already trading down on the news. Will this elevated margin really be able to sustain itself?"
Tariffs? Flight into safe Haven Assets -> Long $UUP,"Alright degenerates, listen up. We're in uncharted waters with Canada slapping 25% tariffs on $115 billion of US goods, but if history‚Äôs any guide, our safe-haven play on the U.S. dollar is rock solid. When trade wars ramp up, uncertainty goes through the roof‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly when global investors scramble for safety.

**Remember the U.S.-China trade war?**  
Despite the steep tariffs and wild rhetoric, investors piled into the dollar and Treasuries like it was a Black Friday sale. Crisis periods have repeatedly shown that when shit hits the fan, the dollar stands as the last bastion of stability. The US remains the world‚Äôs most liquid and stable economy, so when panic sets in, capital flows into it like bees to honey.

This isn‚Äôt just academic‚Äîthis trade simply can‚Äôt go tits up in the sho\*t term. With Nasdaq futures tanking and the risk-off mode in full swing, a sh\*rt-term UUP call is primed for a rally. Even though we might have overbought at a slightly higher premium, the immediate flight-to-safety will likely push UUP higher if uncertainty persists. And sure, if the economic fundamentals take a hit and the Fed starts talking dovish, the long-term picture might shift‚Äîbut we‚Äôre playing for quick gains here.

On the flip side, manufacturing is getting hammered by these tariffs. Industries that rely on cross-border trade are about to feel it, so puts on manufacturing for a 2-4 week horizon make total sense. The safe haven reaction in the sh\*rt term for the dollar and the pressure on industrials aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive; they‚Äôre two sides of the same coin in this trade war mess.

So, when you stack this all up: with the historical context of past trade wars and crisis periods, we‚Äôre looking at a near-term rally in UUP that‚Äôs almost a sure thing. The risk-off sentiment is undeniable, and if you‚Äôre riding the U.S. dollar wave right now, this trade simply can‚Äôt go tits up. Keep your eyes on UUP, monitor the market for any shifts, and tighten those stops if necessary. This is the play, and it‚Äôs backed by both history and the raw market sentiment we‚Äôre seeing today.

$Grab stage 2 breakout,"**Base Formation and Breakout:**

$Grab has built a solid¬†**2.5-year base**, a period of consolidation that often precedes significant price movements. This extended base indicates that the stock has been accumulating, with sellers exhausted and buyers stepping in.The recent¬†**breakout from this base**¬†is a critical signal. Breakouts from long-term bases often lead to substantial price moves as new buyers enter the market, and the stock transitions from accumulation to markup.

[weekly time frame](https://preview.redd.it/vqeyv61l8gge1.png?width=2722&format=png&auto=webp&s=76a8312029ddea00c89ef55c609a81fceeb33311)

**Retest and Rally:**

After the breakout, $Grab¬†**retested the base as support and held**, followed by an explosive rally on¬†**high volume**. This high-volume rally signals strong buying momentum and accumulation by institutional investors.The retest of the base as support is a bullish confirmation, as it shows that the breakout level has now become a strong floor for the stock.

**Retracement and Support:**

The stock retraced to the¬†**0.5 Fibonacci level**, a common retracement level in technical analysis, and found support at the¬†**21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**. This retracement is healthy and indicates that the stock is consolidating before the next leg up.The 21-week EMA is a key dynamic support level, and holding above it suggests that the overall trend remains bullish.

**Breakout of Retracement Trendline:**

$Grab has broken out of the¬†**retracement trendline**¬†and is currently¬†**retesting this trendline**¬†to confirm the breakout. A successful retest would validate the bullish momentum and set the stage for further upside.

**Technical Indicators:**

**Daily RSI:**¬†At¬†**42**, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the lower range, indicating potential for upward movement without being overbought. This low RSI suggests there‚Äôs room for the stock to run higher.**Daily MACD:**¬†A¬†**positive MACD crossover**¬†suggests increasing bullish momentum. The MACD histogram is also turning positive, indicating that bullish momentum is building.**Squeeze Indicator:**¬†The indicator is very close to crossing into a¬†**positive squeeze**, which could signal an imminent breakout. A squeeze indicates that volatility is contracting, and a sharp move (likely upward, given the bullish setup) could follow.**Volume Analysis:**¬†The latest pullback has seen¬†**declining volume**, a positive signal that selling pressure is waning. This suggests that the pullback is likely a consolidation phase rather than a reversal.

# Fundamental Analysis

**Balance Sheet Strength:**

$Grab's balance sheet is robust, with¬†**free cash flow exceeding debt**. This financial stability provides a strong foundation for future growth and reduces the risk of liquidity issues. A company with strong cash flow is better positioned to invest in growth opportunities and weather economic downturns.

**Revenue Growth:**

The company has demonstrated¬†**consistent positive revenue growth since Q1 2022**. This growth trajectory is a key indicator of the company's ability to scale and capture market share. Revenue growth is a critical driver of stock price appreciation, especially for growth-oriented companies like $Grab.

**Earnings Catalyst:**

Earnings are scheduled to be reported on¬†**February 21**. Positive earnings results could act as a catalyst, driving the stock price higher and confirming the bullish technical setup. Earnings reports often serve as inflection points for stocks, especially when combined with a strong technical setup.

DD: Why I'm bearish on $DUOL's next earnings (As a Duolingo user),"tldr: bearish short-term as I'm worried about the conversion and retention rate of key revenue driver(GenAI paid subscription), optimistic on long-term growth, Duolingo is a great app.

DD:

$DUOL has seen tremendous growth since Dec 2022, about the same time ChatGPT was announced, stock has 4x since then. The platform also boasted a 40% jump in total revenues YoY, driven by growth in DAU/MAU and paid subscriptions. There‚Äôs no doubt that Duolingo‚Äôs recent financials paint a picture of strong momentum.

Duolingo's revenue mainly comes from 3 segments, which includes advertising, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. Yet, **approximately 80% of its revenue stems directly from paid subscriptions**. This means Duolingo‚Äôs top line is precariously reliant on convincing free users to make the leap to paid tiers, which is also the reason why the stock price has rocketed given the growth in paid users. However, I'm worried about the current valuation and the growing skepticism about Duolingo‚Äôs conversion rate of the premium subscription tier, **Duolingo Max**.

* **Mixed User Feedback**: Duolingo Max was highlighted in the Sep 2024 Duocon. It's basically a higher tier subscription with additional Gen AI features, where you get to practice speaking, and understand you mistakes more easily. However, the tier costs 29.99 USD / mo, and has received not so postive feedback. I personally tried it and the additonal features are just not worth the price tag. If you go to r/duolingo, and search about Max, there has been many complaints about the Max subscription and almost everybody just hates it.
* **Conversion and Retention Risks**: I've been in the Diamond League for 13 weeks in a row, where over 50% of the users in this league are long term users with 1 year+ streak, and every week I see on average less than 15% of users are actually in the Max tier.
* **Costly AI Investment**: Duolingo could possibily have a 70M expense on R&D this quarter, and the market has had high expectation on revenue boost from the Gen AI subscription. The Gen AI investments could eat into margins. Sustaining Adjusted EBITDA margin improvements could be challenging if AI development costs continue to rise without commensurate boosts in higher-tier subscription revenues.
* **One-Time Growth Drivers**: Recent price boost could due to the Tiktok ban where 'refugees' flooded into Rednote and started learning Mandarin, I gotta say Duolingo has a great marketing team and they have done a great job. However whether they could keep the users is questionable, per my experience Duolingo is unusable without subscribing to it... (I'm subbed to Duolingo Super btw)

To sum it up, I think Duolingo will see growth in users with subscriptions, but if they don't start improving the Gen AI experience with their premium tier subscription, the ROI will be VERY BAD in the coming quarters.

DD: What is going on with China's recent developments in quantum computing?,"Google [Tianyan-504](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google it, right now. Who‚Äôs reporting this? China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the markets don't seem to have a clue.

TL;DR: Simply put, I believe the markets have not reacted to China‚Äôs most recent advancements in quantum computing. China is potentially not as far behind the USA as markets would have you believe. I provide here a commentary of recent market movements, in relation to recent quantum computing news and developments. I follow with a more technical discussion of the significance of China‚Äôs advancements, those of US corporations.

Financial disclaimer: While I justify my comments where possible, some of the comments I make in this post are pure speculation. I do not recommend making speculative trades, such as shorting quantum computing, or buying quantum cybersecurity. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.

I was astounded to see the latest news dominating the headlines. How did the market not know that China was developing its own language-learning models? I‚Äôm a filthy casual, and even I knew about it. It‚Äôs been in our news at least [since July](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/20/deepseek-v2-0628-released-an-improved-open-source-version-of-deepseek-v2/), and available for use [since September last year](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news0905). It was pretty fucking good back then, too. And there‚Äôs Alibaba‚Äôs Qwenchat, Tencent‚Äôs HunYuan, among numerous others they haven‚Äôt even started talking about yet. What else have they forgotten, in this wild speculative bull run? They probably think the USA is lightyears ahead in quantum computing too. Oh, oh. They do.

Before you go any further, look up [Tianyan-504](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml). Look up [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11924). Google them, right now. They‚Äôre right there, massive Chinese developments both announced in December 2024. The Tianyan-504 surpasses 500 qubits, on par with IBM‚Äôs latest developments. And Zuchongzhi 3.0 demolishes Google‚Äôs earlier Sycamore by all key metrics. Why can‚Äôt we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue.

Check out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies.

https://preview.redd.it/4iggbqnq57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5089134b48021f96baf28b66e5a7dc377b7dee7

This suggests that while Google‚Äôs Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia‚Äôs CEO pushed them back down, China‚Äôs developments have had zero impact.

How about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components ‚Äì and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google‚Äôs Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia‚Äôs CEO pushed them back down. China‚Äôs developments have had zero impact.

https://preview.redd.it/e9dnfa0s57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f77fb7a50a22340541b4c426433ff210c9a7fbe0

How about IBM? News about Google‚Äôs Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow‚Äôs performace blew that of IBM‚Äôs September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM‚Äôs position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn‚Äôt the stock price move?

https://preview.redd.it/y6t1ik5t57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=5377770391681d2bfe3ac54d106217216c3f7feb

You can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.

There are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.

The first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of ‚Äì they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.

The second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China‚Äôs past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.

The third possible reason is that China‚Äôs quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts. But since I am not a subject matter expert, and I do not have the time to write in full depth. But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.

China is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.

In 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.

In April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM‚Äôs Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.

On the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.

On the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.On the 9^(th) of December, [Google‚Äôs Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing‚Äôs fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.

Two weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google‚Äôs older Sycamore - ‚ÄúCompared to Google‚Äôs latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70¬† the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.‚Äù Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.

Quantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China‚Äôs chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China‚Äôs technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it‚Äôs regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.

Each advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China‚Äôs achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?

Let me know what you think.

"$ACHR: Now Is the Time for Archer Aviation with Upcoming Certifications, Pilot-only Flight and UAE Confidence of 2025 Commercial Launch","This is going to be an amazing 2025 for Archer Aviation with upcoming catalysts that I will list below. Also, today Archer's Chief Commercial Officer, Nikhil Goal, is speaking today about upcoming KEY milestones for Archer Aviation heading into the print.

**TLDR**: Archer's earnings call is slated for February 24, 2025 after hours. This will mark the an action packed news cycle leading right up the UAE 2025 commercialization. Bonus! There is a credible ""rumor"" but is pure speculation that Archer will begin piloted flight demonstrations on February 14, 2024 which is a couple weeks away. This rumor comes from a reddit post what some believe is the wife of an Archer employee which she deleted shortly thereafter but because it's reddit someone copied and wrote a plausible write up about it.

Whether that's super accurate or not we do know about some very important upcoming catalysts that are expected in the near future.

1. Let's be real, Archer has been dry on major news for a long time now. Almost 3 months since the Anduril announcement and almost a half of a year or longer since the transitions flight demonstration.  This is the moment for Archer to shine amongst its peers and show why they are the leader in eVTOL aircraft both commercial and military. In today's McKinsey's eVTOL Technology seminar Nikhil Goel said, ""**We will be the first in the world to launch commercial operations**.""
2. The UAE is convinced that ARCHER is going to operate by late 2025 which means their guy Dr. Talib and the UAE writ large is committed to Adam and Archer's Timeline. But how do you get there? You get there by rapid certification progress happening from the US side.

https://preview.redd.it/cfer5o4xd6ge1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1809e77983d81cf458962c489a141732c6026bb

Archer has taken the 5 phase process and shrunk it down to 4 phases.

  


https://preview.redd.it/evwd8xe1e6ge1.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f790a97c53c0ce3f28e028fa1ce171cea769475

https://preview.redd.it/rtwwnwm4e6ge1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ca838cc60bb5ceef530386a38d9353c2da1c8f

Here is how Archer has consolidated it down to 4 phases which I believe is the combination of the Implementation phase with the Post Cert Activities phase in order to have an expedited Type Certification that can then be shown and used to the the UAE and their aviation transportation sector GCAA.

https://preview.redd.it/vt7kq9lbe6ge1.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ca145742ae5ccca3849de6e53872225c0d33e60

In Figure 2-9 you will see a process that is namely the TIA (Type Inspection Authorization). This is a critical part of the type certification that is related to the type designed aircraft that will be used to certify the Midnight aircraft and ultimately lead to its Type Certification and it's production Midnight commercial use aircraft.

What is interesting is from Archer's last Q3 earnings call this past November 7, 2024 they have begun critical parts with software and systems integrations with STAGES-1 and STAGES-2 (Stages of Involvement 'FAA') software audits completed. STAGES-3 would be the pre-TIA activity where the software and hardware go through a verification process by the FAA and this is exactly where I think Archer is currently. STAGES-4 would be the final certification review.

What this does signal to me is that Archer is primed and ready for upcoming piloted flights with a pilot-only type designed Midnight aircraft. The type certification will allow them to gain UAE approval with the GCAA allowing them to initiate commercial operations in 2025.

3. I therefore expect flight demonstrations to be imminent as there is not time to waste if 2025 is the goal. There is no way Adam is going to wait until the half or 2nd half of the year to fly midnight in a pilot-only type designed built for production aircraft.

4. I am confident that Nikhil and Adam closed deals in Davos with a premier middle east partner, Saudi Arabia and their transportation agency the GACA. These deal will be announced also in the near term in the least being by the next earnings which is only 2 and a half weeks away.

5. With all of these developments and upcoming pilot flight demonstrations I am also expecting an announcement at this upcoming earnings that Phase 3 of the type certification process has been 100% completed and they are heading directly into TIA phase 4 for credit piloted flight progression.

6. Archer will start to create small batches of the Midnight aircraft which will bring real revenues for the first time since the inception of the company in 2025.

7. Bonus: All of the upcoming Archer and Anduril military application announcements that should have greater detail throughout the year.

All of these factors and more are what I believe is a critical juncture for Archer Aviation and the eVTOL industry. Other players will benefit as well such as Joby, eHang, and Vertical. I wish BETA was public but it is private so us retail can't invest.

This is a speculative investment but it is what I believe is an excellent investment for 2025 based on news and advancements in the transportation industry. As well, the new administration has promised companies regulation priority and investment for those who spend and invest $1 billion or more in manufacturing and development in the US. Archer and Anduril fit this criteria well.

For these reasons I still am maintain a $20 - $30 price target for ACHR.

Here are my current positions in Archer + > 1000 shares and Joby

https://preview.redd.it/metngojee6ge1.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=044969632336d9075493d55eb6740f90415a7f67

Intel will skyrocket after earnings today (AGAIN). Here's why,"Intel reports its earnings today after the bell, and I am certain that the price will pump like last time.

I made a post last quarter predicting Intel would go up after earnings. My reasoning for this play was that the CEO at the time (Pat Gelsinger), was very active on X dropping bible quotes every day. You could just see the desperation in his tweets, and on the day he released the earnings report, God saved Intel, and nana smiled from heaven.

But just because Intel got revived, doesn‚Äôt take away the fact that Pastor Pat was a trash CEO. So he resigned (got fired) on December 1st and got replaced by these two:

[David, who has been the CFO of Intel since 2022, and Michelle, who I have no fucking clue where she worked prior to becoming co-CEO](https://preview.redd.it/bunyel1q16ge1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3743dc87784b3e4dccabc00fb6b17691d7f5cc2)

In the past few days I tried using the same sophisticated due diligence model (scrolling their X page), but these two have a whopping¬†combined....¬†9 tweets¬†since they became CEOs. They mostly consist of announcements written by their marketing-interns, so not that exciting.

Now look, Michelle seems like a nice lady, but we all know who is really calling the shots at Intel here. Today's earnings report will cover the period from¬†October 1 to December 31. I know, David became CEO on¬†December 2nd, but do you really think Pastor Pat just woke up one day and decided he wanted to step down? No, they had been preparing David for months.

But before I even scrolled through his X page, I saw something that could give all of us¬†degens¬†an edge over the fancy new york algorithmic quant funds:

[bro is a steelers fan](https://preview.redd.it/3bpeofcx16ge1.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f1ca91905e2ea1a7dd44115f22fe4648ea5edc0)

So I did some research, David has been responsible for¬†restructuring the company and shaping a better future¬†so Intel can make a comeback. I would say he has been in charge of Intel for at¬†LEAST¬†2 months before Pastor Pat resigned.

There is clear research out there suggesting that there's a correlation between the success of your favorite NFL team and your¬†performance in the workplace. What more of a DD do you need when looking at the performance of the Steelers during this period?

Mfs have won 10 out of their first 13 games. I bet David's¬†dopamine levels have never been higher, he‚Äôs more energized, more optimistic, more productive, and more motivated, and ALL THAT BIG D ENERGY spread throughout the whole company.¬†David had to get the ball rolling.

"Corsair is back on the menu, boys","The future of gaming that rekt us all in 2021 is the future of gaming, again.

The upgrade cycle is upon us, as indicated by the Logitech report last night, which noted gaming sales were unexpectedly ‚Äúnear pandemic highs.‚Äù LOGI's gaming revenue was $467mm vs. est of $393mm. Adding to that is the NVDA RTX 5070 release, which if truly as powerful as a 4090 will drive a GPU upgrade cycle when widely released in Feb.

Google trends results show search interest for ‚ÄúGaming PC‚Äù and ‚ÄúCorsair‚Äù were at their highest in years this holiday season.

In Q3, Corsair lowered EBITDA guidance by 30%, which followed a Q2 reduction in revenue guidance by 15%. This was met with analyst downgrades, which currently have an avg target price of $8.67. Expectations are in the gutter.

This is also supported by valuation, which is trawling the lows with FWD P/E at 11.3x. This is just half of the SPX‚Äôs 20x, and well below the levels we saw from this co in the past.

$MGNI Part 2: Why DOJ vs. Google Could Be a Multi-Bagger Opportunity,"Glad you all enjoyed my¬†[MGNI DD last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i7omel/why_mgni_will_soar_after_nflxs_blowout_earnings/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This afternoon, I did a deeper dive on a catalyst on the horizon that almost no one is takling about. I actually didn't discover this myself until a discussion that stemmed from the comments last week, where a commentor asked about other catalysts that may benefit the stock and I began digging into it.

So, here it is:

**The DOJ vs. Google: What‚Äôs Happening**

The DOJ‚Äôs antitrust case against Google is moving quickly, and 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year. With remedies for both the search monopoly and ad tech trials expected to roll out in the first half of the year, Magnite (MGNI) stands to benefit from a major industry shift that should absolutely factor into the investment thesis.

The DOJ‚Äôs antitrust efforts have gained significant traction, beginning with their landmark win in the search monopoly trial in August 2024. The court ruled that Google held an illegal monopoly in search and text ads, with evidence of document destruction and exclusionary practices further damaging their defense.

[‚ÄòGoogle Is a Monopolist,‚Äô Judge Rules in Landmark Antitrust Case](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html)

**As a result, the upcoming remedies‚Äîexpected in first half of 2025‚Äîcould include:**

‚Ä¢ Ending Default Search Agreements, Divesting Chrome or Android, Mandating Data Sharing, etc.

Meanwhile, the DOJ‚Äôs ad tech trial, which concluded in late 2024, focuses specifically on Google‚Äôs dominance of the sell-side ad market. Google controls 85% of ad auctions through its Ad Manager platform, with a monopolistic 20% take rate compared to an industry average of 10%. The remedies for this case, expected in Q1/Q2 2025, could force Google to divest key ad tech assets or cap their take rates, disrupting their long-held dominance.

**Why MGNI is a Top Beneficiary from the Google Antitrust Case**

Magnite already has a strong core business, as discussed in the previous DD, particularly in the high-growth Connected TV (CTV) advertising market, where they‚Äôve partnered with major players like Netflix and Disney. However, the potential upside from Google‚Äôs antitrust challenges adds another layer to the investment thesis.

Here‚Äôs why MGNI stands to benefit significantly:

*1. Market Leadership*

MGNI is the largest independent supply-side platform, making it a natural destination for ad dollars that may leave Google‚Äôs ecosystem.

*2. Growth in CTV Advertising*

CTV advertising is one of the fastest-growing segments in digital media, and MGNI is already established as a leader in this space. As publishers and advertisers look for alternatives to Google, MGNI is well-positioned to capture that demand.

*3. Valuation Mispricing*

Even without antitrust tailwinds, MGNI appears undervalued based on its standalone business. In Q3 2024, Magnite reported a 23% YoY increase in CTV contribution ex-TAC to $64.4M, highlighting its strong position in the booming ad-supported streaming market. With $50.6M in adjusted EBITDA, the company demonstrates profitable and scalable growth. Sustained momentum in CTV could propel its market cap beyond $5B, solidifying its role as a key industry player.

A $5B market cap would value $MGNI at over $35/share.

**Why Puts on Google Are Also Worth Considering, given that the stock just hit ATH's**

If you‚Äôre bearish on Google‚Äôs ability to navigate all of this, puts could also be a viable play. The antitrust remedies could impact their core business in several ways:

‚Ä¢ Revenue Compression ‚Äì Default search agreements and high ad tech take rates have been key profit drivers. Losing these would significantly reduce margins and revenue.

‚Ä¢ Structural Divestitures ‚Äì Divesting platforms like Chrome or Android would reduce Google‚Äôs network effects and their ability to dominate both search and advertising markets.

‚Ä¢ Behavioral Changes ‚Äì Even without divestitures, remedies like interoperability requirements and capped take rates would make Google‚Äôs ad business far less profitable.

While Google has navigated challenges before, these antitrust remedies are likely to have a much more fundamental impact on their business model than previous fines or restrictions.

**Timing Matters**

As we approach February, the timeline for key antitrust decisions is drawing near, with remedies expected in early 2025. Once finalized, these decisions will likely prompt a market repricing of both Google shares and beneficiaries like $MGNI. For Magnite, the upside is clear: antitrust actions against Google could significantly expand MGNI's addressable market and accelerate growth. Conversely, for Google, the risks are increasing, as the outcomes of these cases could erode its market dominance and profitability.

It's time to place your bets ahead of these developments if you want to hit a multi-bagger.

**TL;DR**

Magnite‚Äôs strong core business already supports a bullish investment case, but the DOJ‚Äôs antitrust actions against Google provide a massive additional catalyst. If remedies play out as expected in 2025, MGNI stock may even find its way back to ATHs, while some of you might consider puts on Google as an alternative play.

If you have other questions on $MGNI, there is a lot of info that can be found in the post and comments of the¬†[previous DD from last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i7omel/why_mgni_will_soar_after_nflxs_blowout_earnings/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

**Position:**¬†Still the same; 6,330 shares of $MGNI and will add to my position on any weakness in the broader market.

DD: UiPath ($PATH) - Mispriced and Misunderstood,"I‚Äôm looking for the regardedest, lowest, humblest of you to confirm the way.

* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when I said PLTR bumpy revenues weren‚Äôt a concern (2022).
* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when I said get into Bitcoin before the wall street wave (2017).
* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when I said Tesla revenues were about to go parabolic (2017).

It‚Äôs true when they say Bears sound smart at parties, but the bulls make money.  Big brains are too smart for their own good, blowing up fears in their minds.

Why do I even posts?  Selfishly, to have a record (Reddit post history) of being right.  I love looking back and saying yep, yep, yep and laughing at big brains while wiping my ass with cash.  I didn‚Äôt go to Harvard or work for a big firm. I have a chip on my shoulder and I‚Äôm here to outclass them all.

So, fellow idiots, I think we have another winner. Time to get hyped.

UiPath ($PATH) $13.86 ($7.617B Market Cap).

**Big brains claim RPA is dead** (https://a16z.com/rip-to-rpa-the-rise-of-intelligent-automation/)

\-	Those pushing AI Agents and claiming RPA is dead are wrong. They assume AI Agents can be developed by skipping straight to step Z, when in reality, they will need to build steps A-Y. AI currently only has a brain. It needs hands and tools connected it to perform real work. UiPath has built out steps A-Y and is ready to take step Z. UiPath is in a position to capitalize on the power of Gen AI.

\-	There‚Äôs a spectrum of automation applications and RPA will still make the most sense in many use cases as the most efficient tool for the job (less processing, lower costs and more energy efficient).  AI Agents will have their place, but UiPath will have a system to orchestrate the spectrum of tools spanning from RPA, hybrid to advanced AI agents.

**Big brains claim UiPath has no moat.**

\-	UiPath‚Äôs product is more differentiated than the market gives them credit for.  The market seems to conflate all RPA vendors as interchangeable, but I believe there are nuanced and important differences between the offerings.  UiPath appears to be the most robust, user friendly and an innovation leader.

Where‚Äôs their moat?

1. Network effects. They have a large install base with 10,000+ customers (easy to upsell clients),
2. UiPath is immune to vendor locking (can automate across many different software provider applications).
3. Preferred vendor/partner to major consulting companies (EY, Deloitte, Accenture).
4. Existing partnerships with major software companies gives UiPath exposure to potential new customers.
5. UiPath has a large base of experienced RPA developers that prefer to use UiPath and who are likely to recommend it where they go.
6. Founder led.  Founder is a product focused engineer, not a career executive playing politics in a bureaucracy. This allows UiPath to be nimbler and seize market opportunities as they arise.

**Big brains claim UiPath‚Äôs growth story is over.**

\-	Gen AI can have a similar effect on UiPath as it did on Palantir and their AIP product. Gen AI will make the existing UiPath platform exponentially more powerful, meaning more and higher value use cases. As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate.

**Big brains have beaten this stock to death.**

\-	This stock is down from all time highs at $85.12/share in 2021 to less than $14/share today.

\-	Big brains seem to be discounting UiPath‚Äôs potential at a current price-to-sales multiple of 5.275x. SAAS companies can easily trade between 10-20x.

\-	UiPath has $1.6B in cash and $0 debt.

\-	82% gross margins.

\-	113% net dollar retention

\-	On the verge of flipping profitable.

\-	Guidance from last earnings call, they said ARR is expected to stabilize and free cash flow to accelerate.

TLDR:

My bet is UiPath has a greater than 50% chance for growth reacceleration.

UiPath product differentiation will become more apparent in the future.

As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate. (i.e. similar to PLTR with AIP).

None of this is financial advice. I may or may not know what I‚Äôm doing.

"$ACHR, In Partnership With Anduril, With Potential DoD/DARPA Funding and Phase 1A Already Underway","Archer Aviation May Be About To Deliver Its 6 Military Aircraft to the USAF AFWERX Commitment Soon Including the Reveal of its NEW Hybrid-Propulsion Military-First Midnight/Anduril Variant Aircraft. I wish you and me small retail investors could invest in Anduril. Here's your chance!

**TLDR**; The Archer Aviation and Anduril partnership is going to be extraordinary. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to invest in Anduril as a retail investor, this is your chance! The collaboration between Archer Aviation and Anduril will bring a hybrid-propulsion aircraft capable of exacting Electronic Warfare (EW), RF/Pulsar Intra-connected multi-spread sensors and mission-critical defense applications on the front lines of modern warfare. For this reason I believe ACHR at levels that are below $10 (initial offering) is worth a much larger MCAP of between $10 - $15 Billion and share price of $27 - $30.

And, The new administration along with Saudi Arabia Investment funds have announced $600 Billion in U.S. Investment and specifically this week at Davos The Saudi investment fund announced $20 Billion with 102 signed deals specifically for aviation build out for projects in Riyadh, NEOM, and the red sea initiatives in Saudi Arabia.

Firstly, I noticed that the¬†[new Archer website](https://defense.archer.com/)¬†for it's¬†[Archer Defense](https://defense.archer.com/)¬†division. It looks super serious and in fact, when you look at this list of accomplished Generals, Lieutenant Generals, and Other Military personal it begs the question; How large, and how significant is this potential program of record with the U.S. Military.

https://preview.redd.it/yrgvvktgtyee1.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=35fb0a1012eeedcc3049a24a96b27736f62f0765

An most interesting update, just this week, it was announced that Lieutenant General (Ret) Scott A. Howell, who left Joby recently, came to Archer Aviation as another military advisor and consultant to Archer and Anduril's partnership. Notably he left Joby 20 days prior to the Anduril partnership announcement and joined Archer 2 months later. To me that is a significant development. This plus finding what I think is the program of record is DARPA air initiative for [Strategic Technology Office-wide Broad Agency Announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACHR/comments/1hyoaq5/breaking_major_news_achr_i_found_the_darpadod/)  is perhaps the program Archer and Anduril will apply to.

Moreover, this quote just released this week by Lt. Gen. Howell is more proof and confirmation to what I have researched and discovered for my thesis. Archer already has begun this program of record and it's significant.

https://preview.redd.it/z92uix3jtyee1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c479e73d9f446abc9cfc4d1b8aaf786fadde416

There are 3 things on the site that caught my attention, besides the obvious amazing announcement of the partnership with Anduril.

At first glance I was thinking this was a down the road thing and that they would have to do something in ""hopes"" that the DoD would fund. But I think this is way more immediate and significant than what I initially thought.

1. Archer places something on the front page of their website that is very interesting. It says¬†**""1. Rapid Development: Proven ability to quickly design, build, and test next gen aircraft within \~18 months""**¬†So there are 2 parts to this.

First, Archer has a history of getting out aircraft in 18 months. I didn't really notice this before. But it fits like a glove. First, they announced and presented Maker in June 3, 2021 and unveiled it June 10, 2021. Literally on the 18 month nose they announced Midnight in November 2022 and presented it in November 15, 2022. After that, they completed its first uncrewed hover test flight on October 24, 2023.

From the initial Midnight unveiling literally roughly \~18 months later Archer completed its first transition flight moving from vertical to wing-borne flight, on June 8, 2024. And 2 months after that Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force for evaluation under the AFWERX Agility Prime contract.

That's a lot of 18 month pacing that they seem to be really be on target for achieving. With that being said, where does all of that 18 month stuff come from? Well, look none other than a current DARPA project with Bell Textron (Bell helicopters) and Aurora Flight Sciences (Boeing). First, let's pause for a moment to look at Aurora's absolutely stunning x-plane concept drone they are building.

https://preview.redd.it/kfysmanptyee1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fd9d0372fd1da39a3365c65823c1ce4525f0e2c

That looks simply fantastic and will fly at Mach 0.7. But that's not the interesting part. Look at the¬†[DARPA project programs page](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/speed-and-runway-independent-technologies).

https://preview.redd.it/z9eulqx5uyee1.png?width=1218&format=png&auto=webp&s=45854e088972f349122db405531109cfc1d61d2e

If you're counting that time time frame is exactly 18 months! 6 months and approximately one year. What this is not explaining is that Phase 1B probably had a 6 month phase 1A which resulted in the 2 aforementioned getting the award to move forward.

So again, look at the website from Archer Defense.

https://preview.redd.it/l6hlw8cguyee1.png?width=2326&format=png&auto=webp&s=809cdf1ceb8736f23c60025d9e4cfdcd9be3bd57

If you notice on the DARPA website there is no longer any information about Phase 1A if it was there. Here's what I mean. I can't find the public listings for November 1 2023 announcements anywhere. But what I can find are clues.¬†[Evtol.news first reported this on Dec 24 2023](https://evtol.news/news/four-companies-dash-for-darpas-sprint).

>On Nov. 1, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([DARPA](https://evtol.news/darpa-ancillary-tactical-drone-proposer)) announced that it had selected four companies ‚Äî¬†[Aurora Flight Sciences](http://evtol.news/aurora/),¬†[Bell](http://evtol.news/bell-air-taxi), Northrop Grumman and¬†[Piasecki Aircraft](https://evtol.news/piasecki-ares-concept-design)¬†‚Äî to design prototypes for a high-speed vertical takeoff and landing (HSVTOL) X-Plane.  
...  
**Aurora Flight Sciences announced on Nov. 15**¬†that it is working on a blended-wing-body design for its bid for SPRINT. For vertical lift, the concept will feature lift fans embedded in the wings. In designing its SPRINT concept,¬†**the Virginia-based Boeing subsidiary will leverage experience on programs like the Boeing X-48 blended wing body aircraft and Aurora Excalibur, a jet-powered VTOL drone.**

This brings me to¬†[Aurora, which announced their participation November 15 2023](https://www.aurora.aero/2023/11/15/aurora-flight-sciences-to-design-high-speed-vertical-lift-x-plane).

>**Program leverages over 30 years of investment in novel VTOL and blended wing body platforms.**

>Aurora Flight Sciences, a Boeing Company, has been selected for phase 1 of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) SPeed and Runway INdependent Technologies (SPRINT) X-Plane Demonstration Project. This project aims to design, build, and fly an X-Plane to demonstrate technologies and integrated concepts necessary for a transformational combination of aircraft speed and runway independence. This initial award funds work to reach a conceptual design review and includes an executable option to continue work through preliminary design review.

Something that was announced on November 1, 2023 was already awarded 1A by November 15, 2023? Damn that's fast. lol. Good job Boeing! My point is, those projects aren't just push a button and get rewarded. They are arduous processes that are tailored to what can be not just awarded but what can be expected to be successfully completed.

They are arduous processes that are tailored to what can be not just awarded but what can be expected to be successfully completed.

Now, here is the juicy part. In that same¬†[eVTOL.news](http://evtol.news/)¬†publication I told you above. There is also this little nugget of information.

>**The SPRINT program builds on an earlier initiative, the Air Force‚Äôs High-Speed VTOL Challenge, launched by AFWERX technology incubator in 2021**¬†(see ‚Äú[Air Force Picks 11 Companies for High-Speed VTOL Program](https://evtol.news/news/air-force-picks-11-companies-for-high-speed-vtol-program),‚Äù¬†*Vertiflite*, March/ April 2022). Of the four SPRINT competitors, three ‚Äî Bell, Northrop Grumman and Piasecki Aircraft ‚Äî were involved in AFWERX‚Äôs Challenge.

AFWERX - Where have we heard that name before? That's right - Archer Aviation is also apart of the AFWERX program! This is my next point from the¬†[defense.archer.com](http://defense.archer.com/)¬†website

2. Archer is already involved heavily in the AFWERX program.

https://preview.redd.it/cv8n7ryruyee1.png?width=2260&format=png&auto=webp&s=56ee376f428429b4c92e537d466931dc194181ca

In case that text is too small let me make it a little larger for you.

**the goal of our $148M\* deal with the air force's AFWERX program is to assess the transformational potential of VTOL technologies for DoD purposes.**

**\*Largest ""up to"" contract awarded by AFWERX to an eVTOL company based on publicly available information as of December 2024.**

This AFWERX Program has been around since April 2021.¬†**To make sure we are tracking here Archer Aviation announced its intention to go public through a Special Purpose Acquisition Company February 10, 2021 and began trading on the NYSE September 17, 2021. Coincidence?**¬†I don't know, but that is very very interesting.

Here's a report again, from¬†[eVTOL.news about the initiation of the program Aug 25 2021](https://evtol.news/news/air-force-challenges-industry-for-high-speed-vtol).

>Air Force Challenges Industry for High-Speed VTOL

>**The US Air Force (USAF), in partnership with the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), initiated the ‚ÄúHigh-Speed Vertical Take-Off and Landing (HSVTOL) Concept Challenge‚Äù**¬†in April (see ‚ÄúIndustry Briefs,‚Äù¬†[*Vertiflite*, July/Aug 2021](https://vtol.org/store/product/vertiflite-julyaugust-2021-16931.cfm)). According to the USAF‚Äôs AFWERX unit, ‚ÄúThe near-term challenge goal is to produce an HSVTOL conceptual framework that maximizes the trade space of speed, range, survivability, payload, size, and flexibility to carry out missions across the full spectrum of conflict and political scenarios. Critical mission profiles include Infiltration and Exfiltration of Special Operations Forces (SOF) and Equipment; Personnel Recovery; Aeromedical Evacuation; and Tactical Mobility.‚Äù A key feature of the HSVTOL Challenge is the amount of publicly available information in order to encourage collaboration and ‚Äúcrowdsourcing‚Äù complementary ideas and technologies.

>**A total of 218 proposals were submitted entries, with 35 solutions selected for further discussion.**¬†According to¬†Aviation Week¬†(‚Äú[AFWerx Challenge Showcases High-Speed VTOL Concepts](https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/emerging-technologies/afwerx-challenge-showcases-high-speed-vtol-concepts),‚Äù Aug. 3), two dozen were focused on aircraft designs (see table below), with the remaining 11 being system technologies (such as improvements to engines, materials or radars). The 35 selected responses were presented to the USAF in mid-August and may receive funding for further research, development and testing, with the potential for future procurement contracts for production and fielding. Four companies made announcements in early August that they had been selected and provided additional insights, as detailed below.

[In February 2022 only 11 survived the first cut (Phase 1) to go through the aforementioned AFWERX HSVTOL program](https://evtol.news/news/air-force-picks-11-companies-for-high-speed-vtol-program). Keep in mind this is not the DARPA The SPRINT X-Plane program but apparently it may have been the precursor program? Remember DARPA's program here notes - ""**The Speed and Runway Independent Technologies (SPRINT) project**¬†is a joint DARPA/U.S. Special Operations Command effort that aims to design, build, and fly an X-plane to demonstrate the key technologies and integrated concepts that enable a transformational combination of aircraft speed and runway independence.""¬†

* American Aerospace Engineering
* Astro Aerospace
* **Bell Textron**
* Continuum Dynamics
* **Jaunt Air Mobility**
* Jetoptera
* Piasecki Aircraft Corporation
* Transcend Air
* Valkyrie Systems Aerospace
* VerdeGo Aero
* Whisper

So to summarize because there is 2 pgrams going on at once. Only 2 of the above listed companies survived to Phase 2 in the AFWERX Challenge.[¬†Bell Textron and Jaunt Air Mobility reported on February 1 2022](https://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?do=main.textpost&id=1F5CEADA-45F0-4FED-8D44-FC4695979372).

As you see, Bell Textron is in both the AFWERX Challenge HSVTOL and DARPA SPRINT programs.

So where is Archer Aviation in all of this you may be wondering because they are part of AFWERX too right? Yes, they are but it's under a different program launched by the US Air Force way back in February 2020 also reported by evtol.news.¬†[This program is called the AFWERX Agility Prime](https://evtol.news/news/us-air-force-moves-to-boost-evtol-development).

>**US Air Force Moves to Boost eVTOL Development**

>The service hopes to help aircraft developers get FAA certification as it weighs becoming an ‚Äúearly adopter‚Äù of air taxi vehicles for utility missions.

The Air Force marked the 116th anniversary of the Dec. 17, 1903, Wright brothers flight at Kitty Hawk by issuing a request for information (RFI)¬†aimed at helping foster a new powered flight revolution ‚Äî electric or hybrid electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft ‚Äî eventually self-flying.  
...  
**Agility Prime has different funding mechanisms designed to support the extremely fast contracting and payment philosophy the Air Force believes is essential to move at ‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù speed.**  
...  
**Rapid Contracting**  
While many are quick to point to the Air Force engagement on the technological side, ‚Äúwhat Dr. Roper and Col. Diller did in terms of procurement is absolutely the biggest innovation of this entire Agility Prime thing,‚Äù said Kyle Clark, CEO of Beta Technologies.

‚ÄúWe all think we are smart, hot sh\*ts for developing airplanes, but Dr. Roper and Col. Diller navigated a massively arcane procurement system and installed something that was fast and efficient. With all my prior years of doing stuff for the Army and for others in my prior businesses, I‚Äôve never seen a procurement activity go that efficiently. So, in my mind, that was probably the biggest innovation and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs giving them an edge over others,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a cultural thing driven by Dr. Roper that was just visionary‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve gone for programs that take a year to contract. That we have received four \[Agility Prime\] contracts in just over a year is astounding,‚Äù said Clark.

From this announcement only these companies were announced in March 3, 2021.

* Joby Aviation
* Beta Technologies
* LIFT Aircraft
* Sabrewing Aircraft
* Elroy Air

Of those you can probably recognize 2 of the above names. Joby and Beta Technologies. But where is Archer Aviation?

Remember, Archer became a publicly traded company in September 17, 2021 from a previous announcement in February 10, 2021. So in March eVTOL News wasn't really aware of Archer Aviation. But boy oh boy Archer was moving FAST and EXECUTING FAST.

The first time we hear about Archer Aviation in the AFWERX program is basically¬†[from their own announcement which was posted on Archer's website September 3, 2021](https://news.archer.com/archer-enters-agreement-with-united-states-air-force-to-collaborate-on-flight-testing). Again, tracking, Archer likes to move FAST, EXECUTE FAST, and apparently, they like to move in SILENCE. Unlike Helicopters no doubt ;-)

From that date about \~20 months later on July 31, 2023 Archer Aviation was awarded through the¬†[U.S. Air Force's AFWERX program a record funding amount of $142 Million](https://investors.archer.com/news/news-details/2023/U.S.-Air-Force-and-Archer-Enter-Into-Contracts-Worth-Up-to-142-Million-Representing-Landmark-Investment-In-eVTOL-Technology-by-U.S.-Military/default.aspx).

AND IF WE'RE TRACKING (yes I'm tracking lol) 18 MONTHS TO THE DAY IS¬†**JANUARY 31, 2025**.

Remember, they delivered their first test Midnight to the Air Force on August 15, 2024.

So where are those 6 aircraft? 18 months is very soon to today's date.

Look at Archer's own words:

https://preview.redd.it/05i6d1m8vyee1.png?width=1741&format=png&auto=webp&s=3741606540574c203aaaa3bdbb7ce84d9331ea0d

Where are those 6 aircraft?

On the FAA registration page for Archer Aviation, Inc we see¬†**6**¬†not yet registered aircraft!

https://preview.redd.it/5s74v74lwyee1.png?width=1956&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a413e737ae7c8a87782edb695fb89960221c186

WOW! If Archer pulls this off it will be a miracle amongst miracles. Adam Goldstein and the Archer Team will become eVTOL sainthood!

3. Archer's military relationship is exhibiting full tilt leadership by executing for the US military in an unprecedented speed, quality, and efficiency.

Archer not only started from behind but in my strong opinion has caught up and surpassed EVERYONE including Joby Aviation with a practical and beautiful production aircraft that is ready now. Adam has been all over the news networks basically saying Midnight is complete we are moving on to a partnership with Anduril on a major DoD project program of record. Here is Adam's News Interview.

Now, I don't know when that program will get officially announced but remember the 15 day window that Aurora basically announced after the fact that they had been selected for the Phase 1A portion of the HSVTOL SPRINT DoD program. Archer may very well be in the program.

**UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO WIN**

**RAPID DEVELOPMENT \~18 MONTHS**

If you're bragging about getting shit done in 18 months lol well those 6 aircraft should be about done.

And just look at this military brass. These guys retire early and this is what they do. They deliver connections and guidance that is unprecedented. And if they smell program winner they are going attach themselves to a program winner.

Do you see 8 highly decorated Army officers on anyone else's website for eVTOL programs? I don't see that on anyone else's website.

I think Archer not only is going after a Government contract I think they have been groomed and ready to dominate a government contract. I think they are about to deliver those 6 aircraft soon! I think there production facility in Georgia was perfectly positioned to not only build Midnight but to also build Nightfall Hybrid-Propulsion VTOL aircraft for the U.S. Military and they may have already begun the work on exactly that.

As well, I think this Anduril partnership and announcement has way bigger implications and way more information than we may realize.

Lastly, I think those 6 aircraft may actually be piloted aircraft and that is why you are seeing all of that¬†[Flight training information in the news](https://www.vertexsolutions.com/news/article/2024/12/vertex-solutions-and-archer-aviation-complete-cutting-edge-mixed-reality-flight-simulator-for-evtol-pilot-training?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

$SANA DD - Short & Sweet: Sana immune evasive tech has unlocked previously impossible therapies -tens/hundreds of billions of dollars worth,"SANA is the first and only one to demonstrate that cells from another person can survive in a HUMAN without immunosuppressant drugs (they literally just demonstrated this in a HUMAN a mere 3 weeks ago, see link below). Sana modified the cells in a specific way to make them evade immune rejection (they have patents on this). With Sana's tech, you can now transplant lab grown cells without fear of rejection.

Since people know how to grow pancreatic islets in the lab (insulin producing/blood sugar regulating cells), they can now implant these in patients and cure type 1 diabetes with Sana's immune evasive tech. Type 1 diabetes is a massive market alone, but Sana's tech is literally applicable to ANY CELL TYPE. Unlocks all sorts of cell therapies previously not possible. Anyone developing a cell therapy, e.g. Replacement liver tissue, blood vessels, cancer killing T cells, etc... can use Sana's tech to make sure the cells aren't rejected. The alternative to using Sana's tech is immunosuppressant drugs, but these are severely flawed and nowhere close to 100% effective - any transplanted lab-grown cells would ultimately die even with immunosuppressants. On top of this fatal flaw, immunosuppresants weaken the patient's immune system, meaning the patient can die from simple infections that a normal healthy person would survive. So Sana's anti-rejection tech is 110% ultra important and necessary for lab-grown cell therapies to survive in a patient. Also, the patients with Sana cells have normal immune systems since they don't need immunosuppressant drugs, so the patients with Sana cells don't need to worry about dying from simple infections.

Sana will make money licensing their immune evasive tech to others and/or developing the cell therapies themselves. So they have an immediate way to make money and longer term options to develop their own cell therapies for even more income. Market size is easily hundred billion plus annually for all these cell therapies, many of which aren't even currently possible (but are possible now due to Sana tech). Compare this to Sana's current market cap of $800 million, healthy balance sheet with $200 million cash, and massive money behind them in the form of the world's largest biotech investors. $SANA undervalued much? I think so.

Source: Me, a stem cell biologist and biomedical engineer working on cell therapy stuff for over a decade.

SANA announced the first demonstration of their immune evasive tech working in a human on Jan. 7, 2025 (https://ir.sana.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sana-biotechnology-announces-positive-clinical-results-type-1). Prior to this, they had done it in monkeys for up to 10 months (they just stopped the experiment after that amount of time), but this is first time it has been shown to work in a human (and their first try of it in a human as well). Photo of them transplanting the immune evasive islets in a human arm here:¬†[https://imgur.com/a/vNoXs3D](https://imgur.com/a/vNoXs3D)¬†It's actually a super simple/inexpensive procedure. Easier than wisdom teeth removal. The cells can be stored at a doctor's office in cheap liquid nitrogen (think special ultra cold refrigerator that's not really expensive).

Positions or ban:

Ok, here's how I'm playing it. Obviously, shares is the safest, but given the short term volatility, I've opted for mostly a large amount of short dated otm calls (see pic below). Also, this is wsb no?

https://preview.redd.it/ym5eesfcdxee1.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=417699c776aae18fb0599cb89e32ef61133e51fb

I want a giant long term position, but given the volatility of the stock, I opted for many cheap out of the money calls. This way I don't expose too much of my capital, yet can still reap the rewards of any explosive upside. To be honest, I don't see why this stock couldn't be $10 next week, it's grossly undervalued at the current market price, but market will do what market wants to do. Within a month or two, I expect that $SANA will have either 1) taken off and ripped higher as people realize its potential or 2) consolidated at some lower price. In scenario 1) my options will have printed sweet tendies that I can let marinate long term if I choose. In scenario 2) I'll be able to establish a large share position at a lower price.

SANA will have many catalysts this year as they continue to report survival data from the cells they implanted in the first human subject, as well as from other trials using their immune evasive cancer killing T cells. The best catalyst possible would be if they announced a license agreement or some sort of non-dilutive investment that gave them a significant amount of cash upfront. To me, this seems a very real possibility. $10+ seems to me extremely likely this year.


Update: Short interest on SANA is now a ridiculous 40%. Given the value of this company's tech, you'd have to be absolutely crazy to short it."
$ACHR 58K YOLO on Weeklies Based on Repeating Pattern Of Hinting A New Partnership,"**TLDR:** My Hypothesis is that an Agreement/Partnership/Investment with **Saudi Arabia** will be announced very soon... Leading ACHR to All Time Highs and beyond...

Why $MGNI Will Soar After $NFLX‚Äôs Blowout Earnings Yesterday,"So after I posted my YOLO on Magnite this morning, some of you mentioned in the comments that it would be helpful for me to drop a DD. Buckle up, my friends‚Äî why I'm long Magnite $MGNI

(Although for some reason I don‚Äôt think of them as ‚ÄúMagnite‚Äù in my head, I say it at Magini or Maggie because that how the ticker sounds lol)

Anyway, let me explain why I think it‚Äôs time to load the boat on shares of this company, and especially how it‚Äôs a play to cash in on the blowout earnings report from Netflix $NFLX yesterday.



# The Play: Buying $MGNI on takeaways from $NFLX‚Äôs blowout quarter yesterday

Obviously, the smart money move isn‚Äôt to wait for a stock to go up to buy it. It‚Äôs to buy when news comes out that you *know* will positively impact future earnings or another company in the sector/industry.¬†

Magnite has been crushing it with partnerships (Disney, Netflix, Samsung, FIFA, and United Airlines are outlined below), and the holiday season being during Q4 means CTV ad spend went through the roof.

Think about it: over the holidays, what were you and your family doing? Watching Disney/Netflix? Streaming sports? Magnite powers the ads you see on those platforms. Now, they‚Äôre set to rake in massive revenue from the holiday season.



# Why Netflix's Q4 Success Signals Big Wins for Magnite üöÄ

Netflix's Q4 2024 earnings smashed expectations, revealing major growth in the ad-supported streaming market‚Äîa sector Magnite ($MGNI) dominates. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

1. Ad Tier Adoption Surges: 55% of Netflix‚Äôs new subscribers in ad-supported markets chose the ad tier, doubling Netflix‚Äôs ad revenue YoY in 2024 and projected to double again in 2025. This expands the addressable market for connected TV (CTV) advertising tech, where Magnite is the clear leader.
2. Magnite's Market Leadership: As the world‚Äôs largest independent sell-side advertising platform, Magnite already earns \~50% of its revenue from CTV and expects to grow that segment by 15% or more annually. Their platform is projected to generate billions in ad spend over the coming years, aligning with Netflix's growth trajectory.
3. Publisher Monetization Boom: Netflix‚Äôs success in monetizing its ad tier proves advertisers want premium CTV inventory. Magnite specializes in helping publishers monetize content, benefiting directly from this growing demand.

Netflix‚Äôs stellar results confirm that ad-supported streaming is here to stay, creating a massive tailwind for Magnite. $MGNI is poised to ride this wave of growth.



# Facts & Data: Magnite‚Äôs Tailwinds üå¨Ô∏è

1. **$25 Billion+ TAM for CTV Advertising -** The connected TV market is exploding, and Magnite is sitting at the center of it all. They‚Äôre the world‚Äôs largest independent sell-side advertising platform, making them the key player for streaming ad monetization.
2. [**Disney Partnership**](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/10/23/2967786/0/en/Disney-and-Magnite-Announce-Two-Year-Deal-Renewal.html)
   * Expanded to include LATAM inventory, podcasts, and live sports.
   * Monetizing College Football live streams on ESPN.
   * Jamie Power, Disney SVP: *‚ÄúMagnite consistently scales its capabilities to meet client needs, helping us stay ahead of emerging market trends.‚Äù*
      1. Note that Magnite allows brands like Disney to whitelist their ad tech as ‚Äútheir own,‚Äù¬†so you might hear Disney talk about the work they are doing to build their ad stack over the next several years.
3. [**Netflix‚Äôs Partnership**](https://www.magnite.com/blog/netflix-selects-magnite-as-key-global-programmatic-advertising-partner/)
   * Magnite is Netflix's programmatic advertising partner globally, which began in summer 2024.
   * Sean Buckley, CRO at Magnite: *‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to help Netflix leverage programmatic advertising to bring their amazing content to millions worldwide.‚Äù*
      1. Note that Magnite allows brands like Netflix to whitelist their ad tech as ‚Äútheir own,‚Äù so you might hear Netflix talk about the work they are doing to build their ad stack over the next several years.
4. **Other Partnerships from the past year**
   * [**Samsung Ads**](https://investor.magnite.com/news-releases/news-release-details/magnite-strengthens-partnership-samsung-ads-power-programmatic): Powering programmatic advertising on Samsung TV Plus
   * [**FIFA**](https://www.magnite.com/press/fifa-selects-magnite-as-part-of-their-global-programmatic-expansion/): Magnite supports global video advertising for FIFA+.
   * [**United Airlines**](https://www.magnite.com/press/united-selects-magnites-springserve-to-power-advertising-solution-for-inflight-personal-device-entertainment/): Ads on inflight personal device entertainment, a new frontier for CTV.
   * [**LG Ad Solutions**](https://www.magnite.com/press/lg-ads-renews-global-partnership-with-magnite/): Deep integration for ad-serving tech across LG‚Äôs global CTV footprint.



# Financials: A Strong Foundation 

* **Q3 2024 Performance**:
   * Revenue: $162M (+8% YoY)
   * Net Income: $5.2M¬†
   * Adjusted EBITDA: $50.6M
   * CTV contribution ex-TAC: $64.4M (+23% YoY)
* **Q4 2024 Earnings Expectations**:With the holiday season and their partnerships firing on all cylinders, expect significant upside.¬†

# Simple Explanation: How Magnite Works 

Ever watched a show on Netflix and seen an ad? That‚Äôs where Magnite comes in. They‚Äôre the tech backbone that connects advertisers with streaming services. Think of them as a digital middleman, making sure the right ads get to the right people, at the right time. For every transaction, Magnite earns a fee.

# Why $MGNI Will Pop 

1. The **Netflix & Disney partnerships** will help fuel this, in addition to other recent partnership announcements outlined above. Both streaming giants are leaning heavily into ad-supported models, with Magnite‚Äôs platform as their backbone.
2. The holiday season drove massive engagement on CTV platforms. Think family binge-watching sessions and College Football bowl games.
3. Magnite‚Äôs **tech leadership** is cementing its dominance in CTV, digital display, and mobile advertising.



**TL;DR**

Netflix‚Äôs earnings yesterday made one thing clear: the future of ad-supported streaming is booming, and Magnite is perfectly positioned to capitalize. Operating in a sector with a $25B+ TAM, blockbuster partnerships, and surging CTV growth, $MGNI is a no-brainer with only a $2.3B market cap.

**Position:** I‚Äôm long like Donkey Kong‚Äî6,330 shares deep. I don‚Äôt mess with calls, but if that‚Äôs your vibe, I‚Äôd go with March calls to play the earnings pop. If anyone wants to throw up a technical analysis of $MGNI, or discuss in the comments, I‚Äôd love to see it (because I don‚Äôt understand that shit).

Decoding the leaked $XP Ponzi report.,"NEWS: Yesterday afternoon a Hindenburg research short report [leaked](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/xp-shares-tumble-on-rumored-hindenburg-short-report-93CH-3822991). This appears to have been a report that they initially intended to publish, but when they made the decision to close down, was instead shifted into SEC tip-off ‚Äì referenced in his farewell address: ‚Äú*As of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today*.‚Äù

However, in a major legal cock-up for Hindenburg, the images from the unpublished draft were available on cached versions of Hindenburg Research's Website, and from these 25 images we can see that one of those Ponzi cases was XP Inc, which is a Brazilian Investment Management company. 

# The Case for a Ponzi Scheme

**Returns are too good.** One of the best ways to look for fraud is to simply looking at who is making the best returns. Funds like Gladius FIM CP IE are posting **2,492% returns** over five years while benchmarks sit at 49%. Coliseu FIM CP IE shows a similar story with **693% returns**. Unrealistically high returns are usually a red flag‚Äîespecially when paired with sharp drawdowns and extreme volatility in stress tests.

https://preview.redd.it/0trki6a1zhee1.jpg?width=760&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8462702b4e7de331be6d6e58c81e52ed81b344c2



**Auditors are being blocked.** KPMG has issued multiple qualified or abstained opinions for XP‚Äôs funds due to missing data. In one case, **92% of liquid assets** couldn‚Äôt be verified. Either XP has terrible bookkeeping, or they‚Äôre hiding something.

https://preview.redd.it/ry2z7jl5zhee1.jpg?width=760&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3efd05ed8067142687bb64d3afc6b71b819b372

**Declining Inflows.** Net inflows are down **36% YoY**, and the company's reliance on market-making activity means it needs a steady stream of new money to keep the machine running. Sound familiar?

https://preview.redd.it/s83rro1jzhee1.jpg?width=760&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5377527b89779bc4a40bf5377b894cb39ecb0d30



**Stress scenarios** for funds like Gladius FIM CP IE show extreme volatility, with worst-case losses nearing -59%. This instability suggests that XP's model could collapse if investor sentiment turns or inflows dry up.

**Hindenburg‚Äôs track record** with Tingo and iLearningEngines speaks for itself, and clearly they were trying to make the connection in their unpublished piece.

"
"Intel will be the surprise overperformer in 2025, starting with the 1/30 ER.","Before I start, I want to preface this by acknowledging the memes and negative connection between intel and the one guy who lost his grandma's funds, but I genuinely believe with how low st. expectations are, combined with intel's massive sell-off these few months, Intel will skyrocket leading up/during the ER @ 1/30/2025.

# 1. Extremely heavy Investments in Manufacturing

* **Tens of Billions Invested**: Intel has invested heavily in manufacturing expansion, aiming to regain technological leadership. These investments are expected to start bearing fruit by 2026 and 2027, positioning Intel as a key U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturer.
   * Now I know ya'll are gonna complain, but that's 2026 and 2027, which is a long ways out! Here's the thing, as long as (they will) Intel acknowleges their progress towards manufacturing, and the expected returns of their investments, especially under the current administration, the upside will be more or less priced in within the report.
* **Alignment with U.S. Government Priorities**: U.S. policy encourages domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, especially with the new Mango administration.
   * It's pretty obvious that the current admin wants to become less dependent on foreign semiconductor manufacturing, and Intel's investments in the space PLUS mango being in power will undoubtedly be great for the stock, and I believe that's what Intel will lean into heavily during the upcoming earnings report with stellar guidance.

# 2. Undervalued Stock Price

* **Current Valuation**: Intel is trading at one of its lowest forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios of the year, at around 20.
* **Intrinsic Value**: Updated discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation indicates an intrinsic value of $36 per share, significantly higher than the current trading price of $19.82. While there may be some other factors, this suggests Intel is trading on a pretty steep discount compared to its market value, way less than other big names.

# 3. Advanced Developments

* **Advanced Node Development**: Intel is investing in advanced manufacturing nodes to close the gap with competitors like TSMC and Samsung. Success in these nodes will make Intel competitive in high-margin markets.
   * I'll admit, I'm not entirely familiar with the development process of these, but I can't imagine this not being bullish for the stock.
* **Gaudi AI Chips**: The release of competitive AI chips (e.g., Gaudi 3) positions Intel to capture a share of the rapidly growing AI market.

# 4. Reduced Competition in Dual Design-Manufacturing Model

* **Unique Positioning**: Intel and Micron remain the only U.S.-based companies pursuing both design and manufacturing, while most competitors focus on design alone. This vertical integration could yield huge advantages as Intel scales.
   * Again, I'm not familiar with the development of chips, but from what I could find, if Intel could pull this off in the long-run, it'll set itself in an extremely unique environment with both design and manufacturing WITHIN the United States. Would be huge for the nation-first agenda under the current administration.

# 5. Support from Geopolitical Tailwinds

* **CHIPS Act Benefits**: Intel is set to benefit from U.S. government incentives under the CHIPS Act, including grants and tax credits for domestic semiconductor manufacturing.
   * Again, huge for a US-based company like Intel.

# 6. Potential Leadership Turnaround

* **CEO Transition**: A change in leadership could bring new strategic clarity and execution capability, particularly in aligning investment timelines with profitability goals.
   * Though Pat was a pretty chill guy, if Intel could bring in someone with large amounts of industry experience, that's another huge upside potential for Intel. They may announce a new CEO during ER or somewhere near it, but I just can't imagine them settling with a mid-tier guy after what they've been through.

# 7. Market Share Opportunities

* **Competitor Weaknesses**: AMD and Nvidia focus on niche areas, leaving room for Intel to grow in data centers, personal computing, and automotive applications.
   * Yes, this does mean that their areas would be very hard to break into, but we've already seen Intel turning around in some aspects, especially their newer desktop gaming GPUs which actually bring in surprising value for performance beyond AMD and Nvidia comparable cards.
* **U.S. Government Contracts**: Intel‚Äôs U.S.-based manufacturing advantage makes it a preferred supplier for defense and other government projects, which is yet another large catalyst for the future.

# 8. Focused Financial Discipline

* **Cost Reductions**: Intel has paused dividends and reduced workforce to save over $10 billion by 2025, stabilizing its financial position during this investment-heavy period.
   * I expect to see this being reflected upon in the upcoming 1/30 ER. With a bit more cash freed up and stabilizing finances, I'm pretty confident that it'll be far beyond what the market has been pricing in which is arguably a worst case doomsday scenario.

# Conclusion

Yes, Intel does have a decent amount of debt. Yes, nana's son did lose hundreds of thousands. But it's objectively true that INTC has been beaten down mercilessly these past few months, with a 56% drawdown since the start of 2024. It's entirely possible- likely even- that this is a far overreaction, especially with INTC taking steps to improve leadership, control debts, free up cash, and invest in what's needed. Combine that with the new administration that went into power yesterday, focusing on heavy domestic production, I believe Intel will be the surprise overperformer for this year.

NFA. I hold around $10k in calls expiring next month after the ER, and I am planning on DCAing aggressively into shares to hold for a few years.

LUNR DD for Non-degenerates,"LUNR DD for non-degenerates

Tl;Dr: LUNR will be volatile, but will just keep slowly rising over the next decade as space missions to the moon materialize and LUNR will be one of the main companies allowing it to happen.

LUNR caught my attention last spring during that moon landing that ‚Äúfailed‚Äù resulting in a spectacular dump despite officials saying that the mission was a success. Sure it tipped over and it would have been nice if it didn‚Äôt, but the purpose of that launch was just to set a benchmark for landing stuff on the moon since we haven‚Äôt done in in decades. However, I did not invest then and only started tracking it.

I opened my first positions in the summer when I saw the RSI dip to literally 10 on all of the time frames, suggesting that it was heavily oversold, but as I looked into the company more and more, it seems obvious that it‚Äôs a long term winner.

You know how all of you unemployed folk keep wondering why you can‚Äôt get jobs or how all of you working at the bottom of the totem pole at work keep wondering why you‚Äôre not getting the promotions over the guys that do nothing all day but kiss ass and play golf? It‚Äôs because in the real world, the awards go to those who are friends with the people at the top.

The way these lunar contracts go is that NASA has a set amount of money to award to private contractors to build components and equipment for the moon missions (Artemis, which is an extensive follow up to Apollo and will culminate in a moon base for operations further into space). NASA doesn‚Äôt want to build everything themselves so think of these contracts as contests. Each contest is for building something new: for example, whoever builds the best rover gets to be the official nasa rover. Different companies, such as LUNR invest time and effort to building these things and then NASA selects a company out of many to win the contract, which then pays the company for their efforts and potentially puts them in favor for winning additional contracts if they prove to be a reliable company to work with.

Guess what? The LUNR guys are ex NASA. Honestly you can probably stop reading the DD here. That‚Äôs all you really need to be convinced that LUNR will win more contracts than the rest of the competition. The run from $3 to $8 was the winning of major contracts that were up in the air. The growth since then has been because they are now looking more and more likely to just become a major major partner moving forward, not just a company that won a few contracts. LUNR is going to be on e of the closest things to investing in NASA itself.

Now the major downside up until VERY RECENTLY was ‚Äúso what? Government contracts? How much money can that possibly be? What if that government funding goes away?‚Äù

Regardless of how you feel about Trump and the incoming administration, his just delivered an inauguration speech where among many things, he announced that we will be prioritizing an expansion into outer space, colonizing mars eventually. The Artemis mission on the moon is the first steps to doing so, as launching from the moon or having bases either in orbit of the moon or on the moon will make missions to mars much easier due to the lower gravity. This has been NASA‚Äôs plan to mars from the start. Not only is the government funding for these moon plays not going to dry up, there‚Äôs a big chance that they‚Äôll expand.

The best part is that this isn‚Äôt just a short term play. In the short term, the stock is very volatile so there‚Äôs plenty of money to be made buying calls when it pulls back, but this is a huge long term play as well. The Artemis missions will last more than a decade. Our presence in space will just continue and with other nations like China joining the space race, we‚Äôre going to see a renaissance of space interest again as NASA finally delivers on all its moon mission goals, and LUNR is going to be one of the major players that are getting money hand over fist to enable it.

SHOULD YOU BUY NOW that it‚Äôs already up so much? Honestly it‚Äôs up to you. It‚Äôs easier for me because I bought when it was $3 back when everyone downvoted LUNR posts claiming that it was just bag holders posting (which was probably true). Even if you lose money in the short term, this stock will eventually keep hitting all time highs year after year, even if there are violent dips in the meantime, so play options with care. Think of it as an extremely jagged stairway up.

What I would do if I were someone who hasn‚Äôt started a position: sell a ton of your other stocks. Buy SHARES with a big chunk of your portfolio. Take a small portion of your portfolio and plan on buying calls for a couple months out every time the RSI on the hourly chart hits 30 and sell a week or so after it hits 70 because it always seems to run for about a week straight before consolidating. Plan on holding those shares for years and sell for long term capital gain.

Because I‚Äôm an idiot, I sold covered calls on my shares and had I not, I‚Äôd be up 300k now, which is a big deal since that‚Äôs triple my salary.

My positions:

12000 shares at $3.65 cost basis
30 sold covered calls at 22.5c for Jan 2026 (RIP - I sold these when it was at 12)
30 sold covered calls at 25c for Jan 2026 (I expect to get exercised on these as well and I regret selling these when it was 15)
90 sold covered calls at 30c for Jan 2027 (the fact that I‚Äôm also nervous about this means that I expect it to potentially rise to this level by then as well)
25x 18c for 3/21 (I‚Äôm always putting in 10k into short term calls on dips and selling like I described above. When I sell these in a few weeks, I‚Äôll just keep rebuying new calls on dips.)



You might be thinking ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the patience to 1.5x to 2x my account over the time frame of a year or more.‚Äù

Okay. I guess you could lose half your inheritance in a single day instead.

"
Carvana - DD from a Senior Finance Manaer,"Brief background - my day job is as a Senior Finance manager at a big tech firm and I have passed all 3 levels of the CFA (not currently working as an active CFA Charterholder). The following is not investment advice.

Been doing hours of research on Carvana since the Hindenberg Research report came out.¬†[https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/)¬†**TLDR on the report**¬†\- there's suspect accounting practices coming out of Carvana. Also looked through all Carvana's 10Q and 10K for the past few years and it does seem that they are turning things around. From a Wall Street perspective, Carvana is doing great. Their margins are going up, they are reducing inventory, net income and EBITDA are both consistently rising... by all financial metrics this company has turned things around.

Here's the kicker. How is this possible in an environment where used car prices are going down (https://site.manheim.com/en/services/consulting/used-vehicle-value-index.html), their loans are over 50% subprime - deep subprime, and their only loan buyer, Ally Financial, lost 20% market cap because they said that on the auto side, their credit challenges have intensified?

It's hard for an outsider to know where to disconnect is but after looking through hundreds of pages of published financial documents, this is where I'm guessing the disconnect is.

Carvana includes the following in their proxy statements:¬†*‚ÄúThe Board may approve transactions only if it determines that the transaction is on terms*¬†**no less favorable in the aggregate**¬†*than those generally available to an unaffiliated third party under similar circumstances‚Äù.*

This means that Carvana can not take unfavorable terms with a third party, a statement which would typically be included so Carvana cannot just pay a related vendor exorbitant amounts of money for equivalent service. However, I believe Carvana is abusing this statement in the opposite way. I believe Carvana itself is getting extremely favorable terms, especially with DriveTime (related private third party) and also the potentially related third party loan buyer per the Hindenberg report (Cerberus).

**If what I believe is happening is true, this means Carvana can sell cars and loans at a significant margin to DriveTime (CEO's dad's private company). DriveTime's internal books would look horrible but Carvana's books would look amazing.**¬†CEO's father Ernie Garcia II has recently sold $1.4b of the company's stock. By contrast, Carvana's quarterly net income has been in the $0M - $85M range. If Ernie Garcia II uses even half of the cash generated from these stock sales, he could well cover any loss DriveTime is incurring from buying Carvana's junk.

Per the Hindenberg Research report, ""A former Carvana director responsible for wholesale inventory told us: ‚Äú\[Selling cars to DriveTime is\] a lever that‚Äôs not talked about. It‚Äôs kind of like Fight Club‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs certain things we don‚Äôt talk about, and we don‚Äôt talk about DriveTime.‚Äù

**Here's the problem**. I don't have experience in legal and I don't know if what they are doing is legal or illegal. I haven't heard of anything that says a private company cannot offer favorable terms to a public company. So as long as the stock keeps shooting up, Ernie Garcia II can keep selling stock to cover the cost of buying Carvana's inventory at a premium, which will make the profit per unit look incredible in a down market.

As long as they keep doing this strategy, Wall Street analyst will see the metrics continually beat historicals and raise their price forecast, which will create a cycle that perpetuates this behavior. However, this is not an infinitely sustainable process and if this is what's currently happening, the house of cards will eventually crumble.

I feel like I have spent way too long looking into Carvana's annual filings and Hindenberg's report. Feel free to ask me anything and I'll do my best to answer with my best opinion.

*Disclosure: I own puts on Carvana.*

Edit: Apparently I should work at Wendy's because I can't spell Manager correctly either.

Edit 2: There are a few catalysts that I am hoping for:

1- Ally Financial management realizes how bad delinquency rates are and cuts ties with Carvana. **Ally releases earnings on Wednesday and major news would affect the price of weeklies. I will do a full analysis on Ally's financials on Wednesday to see if I can get any more details out of them related to Carvana.**

2- New unrelated party loan buyer is exposed to be a related party causing more SEC investigation into related parties.

3- Grant Thornton decides they don't want the risk of a relationship and drops Carvana.

4- Lawsuits around Carvana expose fraud.

5- Whistleblower comes out against Carvana.

Edit 3: 2/13 - Currently holding but have lost 75-85% on all of my positions. Very sad indeed."
Missed Quantum Computing? UFO/alien narrative may be next,"https://preview.redd.it/57jj72n75nde1.png?width=1489&format=png&auto=webp&s=432ff2cb7b591877cfc4f85a08a9317a16f3a379

  
UFO mania has been going mainstream: coverage in influential podcasts, Congressional hearings, national news headlines. Just skim through this recent podcast with alleged whistleblowers¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U7F8MULenA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U7F8MULenA)¬†and the Congressional hearings¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFgXUXeGh6g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFgXUXeGh6g)¬†. Checkout¬†[r/UFOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/). For better or worse, people take this stuff seriously.

I think it's all BS, but that makes it all the more effective for moving human attention and capital. Say I watch one of these videos and convince myself UFOs are real, the next thing I would want to decide is how make money off my exclusive knowledge. The natural next step is to ask what stocks are involved in alien technology R&D.

This is the crux of why I believe alien technology could become one of the next major investment narratives like crypto and quantum computing. If someone were predisposed to believe this stuff, I can see them making large financial investments based on those beliefs.

From other people's internet research, AMTM and SAIC stand out as plausibly linked to the UFO technology narrative. Of the two, AMTM has the more concentrated portfolio around UAP-associated government projects. The company also has reasonable fundamentals with an extensive contract backlog that could insulate the company from the worst of a bear market.

[https://aureliusvalue.substack.com/p/amentum-the-vault-of-secrets](https://aureliusvalue.substack.com/p/amentum-the-vault-of-secrets)

These are long write-ups with many links leading down a deep rabbit hole. Personally I don't take the notion of UFO tech seriously, but have seen enough to believe that this is a topic that many (intelligent) people are genuinely passionate about, not unlike crypto.

I see some parallels to the crypto movement, in that UFO tech receive further attention and spending from the incoming Administration given the interest some key members and the public have expressed in the topic.

If a UFO/alien tech narrative does materialize, this would be an extremely small sector of plausible UFO stocks. In which case I believe this could produce an effect similar to what we saw with quantum computing stocks, causing a handful of publicly traded tickers to see outsized movements (even if the fundamentals are BS).

For the narrative upside, I am long AMTM.

Betting $1M on BLOCK ($SQ) as a bitcoin mining play ,"Jack Dorsey (dad) is the second biggest bitcoin dick rider after Saylor. The problem with Jack is that he's a low key CEO that doesn't like to be in the public eye and therefore sucks at pumping his own stock. This is where we come in. Time to shed some light on how undervalued BLOCK is. 

https://preview.redd.it/0jey95tnemde1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fade12885ceee25efd9999c9b81868c4b9fb794

First, Block is becoming a player in the bitcoin mining space. They are developing their own chip/rig with Proto. Proto is a suite of bitcoin mining products and services designed to help decentralize the global supply of mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate. Proto works to increase builder access to bitcoin mining chips and rigs while increasing network resiliency and making everyday use of bitcoin secure and simple.

Block also has \~8,211 BTC valued at \~$862M.

TRUMP loves crypto and has recently stated he plans to designate Cryptocurrency as a National Priority. He will enact pro-crypto executive orders on day 1 (that's why BTC is mooning right now). He also stated he wants all bitcoin mining to be done in America.

Second, here is a graph of BLOCK's revenue growth vs share price (self-explanatory).

Third, from a TA perspective, the recent price action has been constructive (below) and the breakout from the 2 year base should be explosive.

Not sure how this hasn't caught on as a bitcoin play when all these other shitco's that do bitcoin mining or just have BTC on their balance sheet have absolutely rocketed in the past 4 months. When the hype catches up, we should see some explosive moves up to $100+.

Opening Scene of Ferris Bueller's Day Off:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuOHbyuanbY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuOHbyuanbY)

**Inauguration of Trump Monday**¬†is priced in, and it was priced very high in November (Expectations high). What is not priced in, is the exact outcome of the flood of Executive Orders waiting to signed on Monday. We have some hints of what they will be, but I don‚Äôt think anyone knows exactly what they will be and how they will be viewed from the market. I expect a wild ride, but I don't think the outcomes will match the predictions.

**My Speculation:**

**1. National Emergency**

Who the hell knows what it will be? Economic? Border crisis? Public health? Your guess is as good as mine. But there will be one, and the markets won‚Äôt like it. (There are¬†[several reports](https://www.beckersasc.com/supply-chain/trump-eyes-national-emergency-declaration-to-levy-tariffs.html)¬†on this already.) Plus Trump declared seven national emergencies last time, and another would give him sweeping powers to make significant executive order changes.¬†**Puts on SPX OTM.**

**2. Tariffs**

I‚Äôm taking the man at his word: tariffs are coming. The specifics‚Äîwhat and how much‚Äîremain unknown, but most economists agree this will be bad news. Tariffs also happen to feature in the intro to my favorite movie, so that‚Äôs good enough DD for me. Long¬†**puts on XLY**¬†and throwing in a little¬†**SOYB puts**¬†as well. (Thanks,¬†[Soy Boy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i37uof/spilling_the_beans_on_tariffs_the_untold_story_of/).)

**3. Bitcoin (IBIT)**

I know, I know. But hear me out‚ÄîTrump isn‚Äôt going to do anything to¬†*hurt*¬†BTC. At least not yet. There will at least be signaling of something positive (per many¬†[news sources](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-bitcoin-crypto-day-one-first-100-days-executive-orders-policies/)). Plus, if the S&P 500 goes down, BTC believers will flock to it as a safe haven. If the S&P 500 goes up, BTC holders will reinvest their stock gains to buy more BTC. (My wild speculation is that banking regulation of BTC will be loosened, and the sale of existing US gov BTC will be halted.) Either way, it seems like Bitcoin has an upward trajectory.¬†**Calls on IBIT.**

**4. Hedge**

If the markets tank, they‚Äôll tank hard and my deep OTM puts will pay big. However, there‚Äôs always a chance they‚Äôll go up. To cover my bases, I‚Äôm doing a straddle on SPX on a 1DTE. If I‚Äôm wrong and lose all my puts, the calls might help me break even. And if my puts hit, I won‚Äôt care about the call premium. (Neutral markets? Theta crushes me like a sad ant.) I am sure there is some math that says I am doing it wrong. I will pick up a¬†**call on SPX ATM**¬†towards the end of the day.

**Sidenote:**

I‚Äôm stuck holding¬†**puts on DJT**¬†until it plummets. My DJT calls already paid off, so whatever I get out of those puts is pure profit at this point. As a put on TSLA, because screw them.

I‚Äôve been slowly building these positions over time (which is a very stupid strategy), and it‚Äôs been a rough week. As a rainbow bear, I‚Äôve been getting punished while theta eats me alive. So here‚Äôs a little loss porn for your enjoyment as well to show current positions. If doesn't work out, I am doing ""no options February""...

Edit: Positions didn't come through. (My regards.)

STNG Puts - Biden sanctions induced rally which provides good entry for shorts,"[I wrote this dd](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/198ip3b/stng_part_2_of_my_4_part_red_sea_shipping_series/) some time ago where I bought STNG calls and it worked out [reasonably well,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1992whu/stng_president_selling_i_am_selling_21k_gain_on/) I've been in and out of this name a few other times for small gains. Like all good cyclicals, shipping companies add a ton of supply when they are in a boom and that inevitably creates the conditions for a bust. I think the recent sanctions Biden put gave a rally that provides a good opportunity for shorts looking to participate in what will likely be a bad year or two stretch for product tankers.

[Recent sanctions of russian fleet](https://preview.redd.it/5ahl8wh7rlde1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=83772b0a39909e968af2098c7a4fdfe3da93f5c5)

I think it likely Trump undoes some of these sanctions. I've read that the legal mechanism that Biden used makes it hard for Trump to undo the sanctions until March, but shipping companies are pretty willing to commit crime if they think they can avoid enforcement. In any case, there is a huge wall of shipping supply coming online in 2025. 2% of the DWT (3.2) of the fleet was sanctioned but there is expected to be 7% increase in DWT (12) delivered in newbuilds in 2025.

A lot of this move has gotten front run, and without the recent rally I would not be looking to short, but given the fact that the recent rally erased 2 months of losses I think it possible STNG can bleed down another -20% again pretty rapidly, especially if Trump undoes the recent sanctions or otherwise makes it known that they will not be enforced

STNG has been sort of flailing around lately,  aggressively buying back shares at prices that the market immediately sells through, and they also spent part of their buyback money on DHT last quarter which was unexpected. Here is what they had to say about that

Whenever I see share repurchases at prices well above recent prices I think the company is likely making a mistake. You want to see repurchases put in a bottom.

Iran's crude exports drastically changed in December. As of now I can't see evidence of this forcing refinery closures anywhere. Refinery closures are bearish product tanker rates but the disruption may add ton-miles and more importantly create urgency from fuel buyers that temporarily forces rates higher.

https://preview.redd.it/e0p5pjsqslde1.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa985f783d37c0ba13716d2a8a63280fc87ba38e

Bottom line anything can happen in shipping, if another trade route gets blockaded for whatever reason and forces ton-miles up it can create a lot more demand for tankers. Good luck !

Here are my positions

Good luck"
Spilling the Beans on Tariffs: The Untold Story of Soybeans Part II,"My apologies for the double post. I believe my first post got deleted for failing to share a screen shot. That's fixed (hence the part 2).

I've got some deep seeded DD here, so lentil me your eyes. I promise to keep this brief, because I'm lazy as shit. Soybeans are my play, and we are closing in on the last days to get in the game. Why, you say? 

Because of Tariffs of course. Many of you, may not realize that soybeans account for one of the US's largest exports. And many also may not realize that the largest importer (by far) is China.

Presently,  China purchases [approximately 50%](https://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2024/02/the-united-states-brazil-and-china-soybean-triangle-a-20-year-analysis.html) of US soybeans. However, during the last trade war, Chinas purchases dropped from 60% to just 18%.

What's happened since? China has invested heavily in Brazil's soybean infrastructure. Brazil is presently the largest soybean exporter, surpassing the US.

And China has been [stocking up](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-pivot-us-farm-imports-bolsters-it-against-trade-war-risks-2024-11-01/#:~:text=About%20half%20of%20American%20soybeans,to%20the%20U.S.%20Census%20Bureau.).

What does that mean for soybeans here? Well, presuming China increases it's dependency on other nations to produce soybeans, it means the cost of soybeans goes down and the US soybeans go to waste.

But what about the biofuels tax credits? It's incentivizes vehicles that run on soybean based fuels for US consumers? Guess what? [It expires soon](https://insidetrade.com/daily-news/treasury-issues-guidance-biofuel-credit-punting-final-rules-trump) and Trump will be deciding whether to renew Biden's credit for renewable fuels. Think that's likely?

And let's not forget that the [second largest importer of soybeans has historically been Mexico](https://unitedsoybean.org/issue-briefs/global-markets/).  And guess what he's proposing to do to Mexico? That's right, Tariffs. The last time this happened, Mexico responded with retaliatory tariffs on [US agriculture](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/march/retaliatory-tariffs-reduced-u-s-states-exports-of-agricultural-commodities).

In addition, [soybean farming is dependent on illegal immigrants](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-labor#:~:text=Roughly%20Half%20of%20Hired%20Crop,declined%20to%20about%2040%20percent.). Guess what Trump's plan is? Deportation. 

As to current production, [the current yield was down](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-labor#:~:text=Roughly%20Half%20of%20Hired%20Crop,declined%20to%20about%2040%20percent.), which led to temporary price increases on the presumption of supply and demand. However, Brazil is up. 

Last time there was a trade war, the price per bushel was around 9.30 prior to the tariffs and about 8 after.

Are there any potential upcoming catalysts? Yes! Donald Trump gets sworn into office on Tuesday. He has promised to levy these tariffs day 1.

So what did I invest in? Puts on SOYB. This is a composite of the price of soybeans.

During the last trade war, it went from ~$19 to ~$15 in 3 months and bottomed out at about $13 at the peak of the trade wars. 

As a result, I presently don't like this stock, so I have 137 puts expiring in May."
NBIS - Options Activity and Call Walls,"Positions have adapted slightly since my previous post but I‚Äôll be long NBIS for the foreseeable future, conservatively targeting $65 a share.

PCR is around 0.3, with most OTM volume around $38 and $40 strikes.

This plays into the resistance at 38. The next major expiry comes into play on Feb 21st, with open interest largely concentrated around these two strikes.

Past this date, $40 strike continues to represent a large portion of open interest, and represents the next major call wall.

As for Feb 21st, This is one week after earnings, which should (hopefully) provide much more insight into the KC GPU Clusters which are scheduled to go live in Q1.

Combined with the expanded capacity at their data center in Finland, and the newly introduced H200 GPUs, there should be lots of ammunition to increase bullish sentiment and expand analyst coverage.

At the current liquidity levels, it looks to me like the stage is set for a gamma squeeze at 40, barring a negative catalyst in the short term.

With a firm as pessimistic as Citron being openly bullish on the CEO, I think there‚Äôs reason to be optimistic that they will deliver on schedule with the KC facility, and set the stage for continued investment in infrastructure through 2025.

This should drive the price significantly higher.

SENS: it‚Äôs back,"Do you like making money? So do I, which is why I‚Äôm balls deep in SENS and my wife‚Äôs BF is balls deep in‚Ä¶well, you know.

Anywho, most of you have probably heard of SENS but if you haven‚Äôt, they are a boomed with the longest lasting CGM system with a whooping 365 day approval that just went live last quarter. Think dexcom but 20x longevity.

That being said, you might say, ‚ÄúBut Pooner, this bitch already done did run over 200% off its lows‚Äù and I‚Äôll agree, but I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs done.

From a fundamentals perspective they recently released preliminary numbers for q4 which were absolutely explosive, but don‚Äôt take my word, read here (because it‚Äôs easier than typing it out). https://www.senseonics.com/investor-relations/news-releases/2025/01-08-2025-231228075
 
Holy cow! Talk about amazing, but they still have to continue that trend of increasing numbers, and how might they do that? Well 2 of the upcoming catalysts may help with that. In Q1, Senseonics is expected to release news on pump integration, a necessity if they truly want to be comparable to competitors. Additionally the trial period for the pediatric study will conclude by March. Other catalysts are in the pipeline but atm not worth mentioning and shouldn‚Äôt be a consideration IMO.

Lastly in TA, 2 very bullish crossings have occurred in the last week, the 50 MA over the 200 on the daily chart and the 10 over the 50 on the weekly chart. The last time these golden crosses occurred was Jan 2021, running from .4->$5+. To account for dilutions this would be $3+.

‚ÄúBut Pooner, I see you have a pretty substantial position with solid gains already, how do I know you aren‚Äôt trying to offload your bags onto me.‚Äù That‚Äôs the fun part, you don‚Äôt! You can believe me or not but here is my trading plan. Tomorrow I‚Äôm expecting a jump above 1$, hopefully turning my 1/17 1cs into baggers so I can close and use profits to exercise my .5cs. Aside from that, my first target for offloading is in the 1.35 range where I‚Äôm cutting about 30%. Everything else is long term unless it jumps to 3, which I‚Äôd shave all but 25% of my position looking to rebuy lower.

TH and the Immigration Trifecta,"Target Hospitality (TH) is a relatively overlooked potential beneficiary of Trump‚Äôs Immigration policy. They are one of the largest providers of temporary accommodations. These temporary accommodations have been used for (a) immigration, and (b) large construction projects - think infrastructure build-outs or oil exploration. This chart shows they have benefited from contracts under all recent administrations.¬†**They did especially well under Trump‚Äôs previous administration.**

https://preview.redd.it/murphr17sede1.png?width=1148&format=png&auto=webp&s=815a9700f682c01faed351f064ed4ed01c6ce2e1

  
**Indications They Are Vying For Immigration Contracts**

On Nov 18, 2024 - immediately after the election - they brought on board a former Chief of US Border Patrol under Trump.¬†If that was not telling enough, the ACLU announced this week that a FOI act request makes clear they submitted a proposal to expand ICE‚Äôs detention capacity and facilities.

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1712189\/000171218924000082\/ex99-1.htm](https://preview.redd.it/x92tzbybsede1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9a4a8005f6a63face54d545f33fea822153dce1)

**The Scale of Opportunity**

Now the WSJ has estimated that Trump‚Äôs plan could cost \~160b, and detention centers by far stand to be the greatest beneficiaries - costing \~168b.

[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eqPgAU1JRL4](https://preview.redd.it/nklhqzcusede1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=db0e51ff20612a0424cdbc4e163a03f4913b0226)

*TH currently has a 1 billion enterprise value. If they received even a small portion of the expected cost of detaining immigrants, they would stand to be worth far more.*

**The oil exploration opportunity**

Aside from Immigration Policy, Trump is most vocal about increasing oil production within the US. Again, TH is well positioned to benefit here - providing lodging throughout the Permian basin.

https://preview.redd.it/q8l1wu6wsede1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8dc8706e1f94c7cce74e414b7b11e5ca93ca1b

**Comps**

The two other players in this space are CXW and GEO. They have both already seen sharp moves both upon Trump winning the election and now in anticipation of him taking office and taking swift action to limit illegal immigration. And despite running massively, price targets have recently been raised.

https://preview.redd.it/6h4symaxsede1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9eea46c31f05d4b2d859ebd6fc6074eb88d46a8

Both of these operate private prisons and detention centers. The thesis for these names has been widely circulated, so there is little value in re-iterating it here. However, they are important comps for Target Hospitality (TH) and illustrate some of the possible upside to the trade. Notably TH is ‚Öô of the size of GEO, and trades at much lower valuations.

**Frankly, given the size of necessary expenditures - all of these stand to be winners. IMO, TH offers the greatest possible upside at this juncture.**

CorMedix (CRMD): My Regarded DD & Position. ,"**A)You guys didn't like my last regarded post so here's my DD; and**

**(B)The following is my opinion, and is NOT investment advice**. ¬†¬†

**TLDR:**¬†¬†I believe CorMedix will be $25-$50 by EOY‚Ä¶ Mark my regardation... Enjoy.¬†

**Summary:**¬†CorMedix ran 214% since August 2024. I believe CRMD will run to $25-$50 before year end. However, I could not post it prior to its previous run due to WSB‚Äôs post requirements. I cited as much as I could to be: (a) transparent; and (b) illustrate my thought process. (Obviously, the price point and projection is my opinion based on the available data.)¬†

**Position:**

https://preview.redd.it/f1s8mqj5scde1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e0f9ab4c64a58d73a3d6864bbe658c04c4e9ba2

**NOTE**\*\*:\*\* ‚ÄúId.‚Äù means the same document or page if without a corresponding page number.¬†All Ids. should be referencing the prior source i.e., non-interchanging. If not then it is a mistake, and use your best judgement in reviewing all the sources...Lastly, some sources you're going to have to look up yourself, i.e., 2024 Q3 Earnings transcripts/calls. 

Cormedix is a biotech company that has an FDA approved product called Defencath.(See Investor Deck Page 3[¬†https://cormedix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CorMedix-Corp-Presentation\_11-7-24.pdf](https://cormedix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CorMedix-Corp-Presentation_11-7-24.pdf)) Defencath is a catheter lock solution that prevents Catheter Related Blood Infections (CRBIS) for people who are receiving Hemodialysis(HD) as a result of kidney failure. (Id. at page 3.) Defencath reduces incident rates of CRBISs by 71% and an efficacy rate of .00006.(See¬†[https://www.defencath.com/safety](https://www.defencath.com/safety)). Approximately 170,000 patients that are on (HD) have CVCs.(Id. at page 17.) The total addressable market for Defencath is between 37 million to 46 million in the out-patient setting. (Id. at 17). The total addressable market on the in-patient side is approximately 3.8 million vials (Id. at 15).¬†

A Central Venous Catheter (CVC) is surgically implanted in a patient so they can receive HD. The HD session allows the blood to exit the body, and enter a dialysis machine to filter out the waste. Think of a dialysis machine as an artificial kidney. The blood must travel through the CVC in order for it to eliminate waste from a patient's blood. This population, as a result of having a CVC, is susceptible to CRBISs composed of: (1) gram positive bacteria; (2) gram negative bacteria; and (3) fungal infections; that grow within the CVC. (See video:[¬†https://www.defencath.com/how-defencath-works](https://www.defencath.com/how-defencath-works)) Therefore, Defencath cleans the CVC to prevent these infections before and after HD sessions.¬†

**For the Clearguard Brigade:**¬†as the Clearguard caps are only 61% effective after 3 months‚Äìas opposed to Cormedix‚Äôs post marketing study from EU, where¬†**DEFENCATH reduced CRBISs by 96%:¬†‚ÄúUnder the study, 202 hemodialysis patients at 20 hemodialysis centers in Germany were enrolled in the ongoing Neutrolin Use Monitoring Program (NUMP), representing 15,464 dialysis sessions over a 26-month period, for a total of 36,083 hemodialysis catheter days. These data demonstrated that use of Neutrolin is associated with 96.0% reduction in the rate of CRBSI and 96.7% reduction in thrombosis compared to published historical benchmarks of 3.5 CRBSIs and 2-3 episodes of thrombosis per 1,000 catheter days.‚Äù¬†(See**¬†[**https://cormedix.com/defencath/neutrolin-in-europe/**](https://cormedix.com/defencath/neutrolin-in-europe/)**)**¬†Reminder‚ÄìNeutroline was Defencath‚Äôs name prior to it being changed in the states.¬†Obviously, it was not an FDA post-marketing study, but it is a hint to how it will preform on its' post marketing study, in the U.S.. (I believe the above is the correct interpretation, feel free to doublecheck me.)

Since the HD population typically receives treatments three (3x)¬† times a week, and two vials are required per each session to prevent CRBIS. This is why the total addressable market, when fully implemented, is projected to sell between 37 million and 47 million vials per year. (see investor deck).¬†¬†

Cormedix secured 60% of the out-patient centers, and the top 5 companies control 85% of the market. Cormedix already has contracts with the four (4) of the five (5) top market participants as well as smaller providers.¬†(See¬†2024 Q3 Earnings call....¬†quoting(""We recently announced new agreements with two midsized dialysis operators and one large-scale operator, which combined with our existing customers will provide patients access to DefenCath at roughly 60% of dialysis clinics in the U.S. We are currently working diligently with our new partners to operationalize those agreements and currently expect purchases to commence for all three before the end of the fourth quarter."")).

In Q3 of 2024 CRMD earned 11.5 million.¬†**However**, in Q4 of 2024, CRMD beat estimates by securing¬†**$31 million, and is reported to have 25 million in**¬†***open***¬†**orders in Q1 of 2025.**¬† (See[¬†https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-preliminary-fourth-quarter-2024-results-and-provides-business-update/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-preliminary-fourth-quarter-2024-results-and-provides-business-update/)).

**Q-10 10/30/24:**¬†

On April 18, 2024 CorMedix Transitional Drug Add-on-Payment (TDAPA) was granted by CMS for ESRD patients which provides temporary additional payments for certain new drugs. The TDAPA‚Äôs reimbursement is calculated on 100% of the WAC. (See page 22 of 10-Q CorMedix 10/30/24, quoting(‚ÄúThe HCPCS J-code for DefenCath was published by CMS on April 2, 2024. TDAPA reimbursement is calculated based on 100 percent ASP (or 100 percent of wholesale acquisition price or manufacturers‚Äô list price, respectively, if such data is unavailable). TDAPA and post-TDAPA add-on payment adjustments for DefenCath apply for five years (with such add-on payments applying to all ESRD PPS payments for years three through five). CMS confirmed a July 1, 2024 implementation date for HCPCS and TDAPA.‚Äù)).¬†¬†

April 26, 2023 Cormedix was granted a New Technology Add-On Payment(NTAP) which reimburses in-patient facilities of 75% of the WAC per 3 mL vial. The average hospital stay is approximately 19.5 vials per hospital stay. The WAC price is 249.99 per 3 mL vial. (See page 22 of 10-Q CorMedix 10/30/24)

On June 6, 2024, Cormedix announced medicare via its hospital out-patient system granted Defencath a ‚Äúpass-through status.‚Äù Medicare basically pays separately for Defencath when it is used in outpatient settings rather than bundling it with other payments. The company estimates 100,000 CVC placements for HD patients that occurs annually. This pass-through status allows out-patient providers to be reimbursed as a result. This pass through payment status is at minimum 2 years and at max three years. (Id. at 22)

In June of 2024 CRMD received feedback from FDA for expansion for other indications for Defencath, and three (3) clinical protocols were discussed: (1) a post-marketing requirement for pediatric HD to ensure efficacy; (2) Phase 3 TPN study for adult TPN patients; and (3) EAP to allow patients access to Defencath prior to approval for those with CVCs.(Id. At 23).¬† The TPN & Pediatric HD study are projected to begin in 2025.(Id.)¬†

Patent protection for Defencath is until 2042 (Id at 23.)¬†

**Key points for TDAPA**¬†

* TDAPA commenced on July 1st and applies to all Medicare fee-for-service patients, which comprises roughly 45% of all ESRD patients in the United States. Medicare Advantage, comprising an additional 45% of ESRD patients, remains an opportunity for growth and expansion for the DefenCath reimbursement. We have been engaged with all major Medicare Advantage organizations across the country, and we are happy to report that UnitedHealthcare, the largest MA plan in the country in terms of covered lives, which accounts for roughly 30% of Medicare Advantage enrollment, has confirmed that they will provide comparable TDAPA reimbursement for DefenCath beginning on September 1st.
* Humana, which comprises roughly 20% of Medicare Advantage population, has also confirmed that they will provide TDAPA reimbursement, which may vary, depending on provider contracts. As we progress through our first year of launch, the company intends to remain engaged with Medicare Advantage plans to ensure adequate reimbursement to operators.¬†
* From a long-term perspective, the company believes that ESRD Medicare patients, in general, will -- that -- will continue to migrate from Medicare fee-for-service into Medicare Advantage plans and that the value-based care proposition for DefenCath will resonate with MA plans and hopefully result in long-term sustainable separate reimbursement in this patient segment.

*I'm actually shocked, had you read this far in....*

**NOTE: This is what I think could happen for Q1 of 2025 and it is only my belief/opinion ... I'm Regarded:** I believe the company will earn anywhere from 51 million to 71 million for Q1 of 2025. This takes into account the following factors: (1) 2000 of 4000Fresenius patients (which is 10% of their CVC patients), and (2) it assumes we correctly did the math for 31 million Q4's 2024; (3) additional patients are receiving Defencath as a treatment as part of the ""ramp up."" ... I'm sure there are smarter people than me out here who can double check everything...

"$RGTI CEO: US taxpayers are their main ""customers"" who pay their ""revenue"", need to lower expectations on commercial use","Hello quantum ""experts"",

Are your RGTI profits both in your account and not in your account? I guess it depends when you look at it.

Last I looked, I made 6X my money with $7 puts, In this post I questioned RGTI's revenue sources before the CEO admitted what they are, see below.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hy9meh/rgti\_needs\_to\_come\_clean\_on\_revenue\_sources\_or/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hy9meh/rgti_needs_to_come_clean_on_revenue_sources_or/)

and the other time I looked, I made 10X my money with $15 puts for last week, and in this post I questioned why they sold 100M worth of stock and diluted the shareholders at $2 if they believed the company is worth more....like $20.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hsszsq/rgti\_management\_sold\_at\_2\_giving\_us\_the\_shortest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hsszsq/rgti_management_sold_at_2_giving_us_the_shortest/)

Why am I so focused on RGTI? I do not appreciate management that keeps silent and coy when their stock is hyped and overvalued. Back in the day, it was customary for companies to issue PRs saying ""We are not aware of any company developments that might have caused the recent stock activity and volatility"" and the stock would settle down. Nowadays, they are salivating at the greed of others as well as the aggregate disregard for rationality in pursuit of yields and profits. So they kept silent and probably fumed for issuing stock at $2 instead of $20.¬†

Well, the silence was broken by RGTI's CEO a couple of times this week, and it was a sh\*t show both times.

First at the Needham conference....well, just watch the first few seconds of the disclaimer RGTI asked the moderator to recite before the interview, and the CEOs reaction to it. People getting up and walking away in dismay.

Some paraphrased soundbites;

1. They are not concerned with sales but they are focused on technology
2. Their ""stuff"" is used by their research partners for scientific research and not commercial purposes - NVDA's Jensen was right
3. They depend on Fermilab for funneling government funds/grants onto them. By the way, Fermilab was shut down in the summer for a while due to lack of funding.
4. They salivate and pray that a new government budget is being proposed/passed for increased spending on quantum because.....drum roll....
5. They rely almost fully on government funds/grants, i.e. YOUR TAX MONEY and mine, to survive and play with flux capacitors. EDIT: they also rely on dumping money on the dumb public which is clueless what quantum is and what it does or does not do, but that is beyond the scope of this post.

Total mess, have a watch, just don't die from cringe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upj8EAT-HZM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upj8EAT-HZM)

Then, in this Yahoo segment, he plays a good guy saying that we need to lower our expectations on quantum commercialization, while at the same time he has the audacity to throw ""others"" in the industry under the bus for making exaggerated claims about large revenues from quantum, which he implies are NOT happening and we all knew that all along...Have a watch:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rigetti-computing-ceo-hype-stock-130000567.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rigetti-computing-ceo-hype-stock-130000567.html)

No, RGTI needed to calm the public down when the stock shot up from pennies to over $20 and tell them that it is still in an R&D stage and it has no commercial applications in the real world outside of government sponsored research circles. That should have served the purpose and kept RGIT at $2 or below. But no, it needed to be be coy and mum, right?

At the same time, not once did RGTI mention the word ""research grant"" in their last 10-Q, and kept referring to entities where ""revenue"" comes from as ""customers"" even though it is obvious from the interviews that it is research partners which share the same grant money are their ""customers"" but in the end, it is you and I the dumb idiotic tax paying public that has no idea where tax money goes and how it is spent. They go as far as doing a full blown customer segmentation by geography and ""customer size"" while the SEO admitted it is pretty much all government research funds they claim as ""revenues"".

EDIT: Well, RGTI algos remained regarded and pinned the 10 strike for what felt like eternity, only to drop it at the end and they still to 5 cents from me because as soon as my order filled the price moved to 22.5 mid. This is my tip to the casino waitress for the week, still up 13X my initial investment in the 15s and then the 7s, so I am bidding RGTI and all of you a farewell.....until next time, which is probably next Thursday.

SERV's food delivery robots will fail and I can prove it,"https://preview.redd.it/bofd5uleb7de1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecd1178ed4bda7f8ef6c000f100fb769464dd705

You thought it would be because of crackheads and homeless people? Nope, those are the least of Serve Robotics' worries. 



The company has a history of not only being unprofitable, but also having negative gross margins. That's REALLY bad, the cost of operating their robots is higher than the revenue generated from them. It's the equivalent of buying high and selling low, I'm sure you regards are familiar with that.

This would be fine if the company focused on improving the robot's efficiency, autonomy and costs until they can demonstrate potential future profitability...

But instead, this year they suddenly decided to start manufacturing 2000 of their 3rd generation robot. That's a 20x increase from their current fleet of 100 robots. These robots cost more to produce than an average car, this sudden ramp up will put a lot of financial pressure on the company. The CEO's reasoning: this mass production contract will help drive the robot's cost down.



*By the way, did you know their robots are actually remote controlled with a PS5 controller 20% of the time?*

[From SERV's 10-K 2023 SEC filing](https://preview.redd.it/q3zaju5vb7de1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1aac7002652983d323481aaf88297d549d30988)

Anyways, let's run the numbers down. Don't skip to the TLDR yet I'll try to make it interesting.

What we want to figure out is a future projection of:

* a robot's average yearly revenue
* its associated yearly costs as well as production costs
* calculate the years it takes to get a return on investment

Let's first take a look at their fleet's current revenue.

[From SERV's latest quarterly report](https://preview.redd.it/67fawqkec7de1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=02b62e9a6900fd04f87a36d1891284e6161d91f0)

Extrapolated yearly, that's $450k in delivery revenue generated by the robots. But how many robots were active during that period?

https://preview.redd.it/hligx3cic7de1.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c085ee410181ab38760de0fc31c6f685e272444

The ""daily supply hours"" indicate a daily runtime of about 8h per robot. 

On average, 59 daily active robots. Extrapolating the quarterly data, that gives us an average yearly delivery revenue per robot of... **$7612**.



Does that sound bad? We haven't even looked at the cost of operating each of these robots, and just comparing that yearly revenue to the manufacturing cost of the robot makes you question how they could ever reach profitability. 



I dug into their [SEC filings](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1832483/000121390024018566/ea0200355ex10-16_serverobot.htm) and found out their current 2nd generation robots cost them **$63,654** each. It's very unsurprising the CEO never talks about that number in any of his numerous interviews. It would currently take a robot 8 years to gain enough delivery revenue to pay back its initial production cost.



We haven't even talked about the cost of revenue yet, Is it already all over for Serve robotics? No, remember, what we're interested in is a projection of their future profitability. 



According to the company, their 3rd gen delivery robots that will begin manufacturing will have more battery autonomy, higher top speeds (up to 11mph, looking forward to the inevitable accidents and lawsuits), and a production cost per robot slashed by half.



I booted up excel and ran the numbers. Considering the delivery revenue efficiency per robot hours barely went up between 2023 and 2024, I'm projecting a charitable improved daily robot runtime (currently at 8h) and delivery efficiency increase based on the new gen robot specs. Also accounting for the halved robot cost ($32,000):

[values are per robot](https://preview.redd.it/ckldrv0dd7de1.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=02a0c75367a05a732cf3623d50ffea942aa52f83)

Not looking great...

And I'm not done, lets get to the fun part! Expenses.



These are the expenses that directly scale with the number of robots:

* **Robot remote control and monitoring:**

As I've mentioned before, the robots need to be remote controlled 20% of the time to navigate ""complicated"" situations like intersection crossings. For a robot daily uptime of 10 hours, that's 2 hours of human work time. In reality, more than 2 hours would be necessary as the amount of robots needing human control at the same time will spike. Let's go with 2.5 hours as a conservative estimate. At a rate of 20$/hour, that's... $18,250 spent yearly per robot. 

* **Robot repairs and maintenance:**

Yearly robot repairs and maintenance typically amount to 10 to 20% of their initial cost. Considering SERV's robots operate outside, sometimes under rain and other bad conditions, their maintenance costs are probably higher but let's use the conservative estimate of 10%, so $3200 per year.



Those are the two biggest expenses, I'll ignore mobile internet costs (each robot livestreams video feed to human operators), the cost to physically help the robot when it gets toppled over, energy cost to repair batteries, etc.



Before we get to the final projection, it's important to take into account a secondary revenue source for their robots: advertisement revenue. Ads they stick on the sides and top of the robot. I chose an estimate of $800 a month per robot in ad revenue. For reference, full car wrap ad services typically pay at maximum $400/month.



And here we have the final projection:

[values are per robot](https://preview.redd.it/4gr0dcn7e7de1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab2493adeaa67574b7f9950de2da425b3b5f31ce)

Even with the most charitable projection, 6 years to recoup the robot's production cost is way too long to be profitable. The robot's lifespan might not even exceed 5 years. The real cost of operating the robots will also very likely be much higher than my estimation.

# A bit of history

SERV is currently valued at over 1 billion dollars. When it IPOed, at the beginning of 2024, it was priced at a valuation of 100 Million, and its stock quickly dropped by half once it hit the market. Since then, it diluted its shares by more than 2x. 

So why did the stock massively pump 2000% in the middle of the year? That happened after the reveal of NVIDIA's $12M investment (at the time, 10% ownership) in the company. 

NVIDIA's venture capital arm ([Nventures](https://www.nventures.ai/)), invested in the company back in 2022. It invests in all sorts of innovative AI companies who use their products. NVIDIA has a vested interest in the company successfully operating autonomous delivery robots, it's great advertisement for their Jetson modules and the advancement of AI. That does not mean NVIDIA believes or really cares that much about the company being able to generate a profit.

# My prediction

The 2000 robots, all supposedly manufactured during 2025, will cost the company an initial 60 million dollars. As the robots begin operating, costs will balloon 20 times over and revenue won't catch up. Serve Robotics will continue bleeding money at a much faster pace, and will keep diluting shares. Insiders started selling a lot of shares in the past 2 months ($3M). I expect it might take a while for the price to correct itself, but considering how overvalued SERV is right now I'm confident in shorting it and I expect it to drop during future financial reports.

NBIS - Picks & Shovels but make it AI,"TL:DR :

* Company makes infrastructure for AI workloads at extremely impressive efficiency levels. Proprietary configuration for GPU clusters (first in NA to complete in Q1), has efficiency levels and compute performance beyond that of Tesla's latest creation, which NVDA Jensen said described as remarkable. Tip of the iceberg
* $700 mil invested by NVIDIA, who is supplying H100 Hopper GPUs for their cluster models with the first being constructed in KC, with plans to integrate Blackwell GPU H2 2025.
* Minimal debt totaling $27mil with a near $2bil in cash, $1bil+ planned infrastructure development in 25', with ARR forecast of $750m-1b

Primary focus is not some unremarkable data processing system that every SV chump and his grandma are pushing down throats. Nebius was sitting on some already profitable infrastructure in Finland and decided they could expand, replicate and improve across Europe and North America.

They were able to secure listing on the NASDAQ, and quickly obtained a $700 mil investment from Nvidia. Contrary to the few posts from your normal run of the mill bullshit like Motley fool etc..., this part on it's own is actually meaningless. Companies the size on Nvidia throw hail mary's at startups all the time and don't blink when they fail. However, in the context of their lofty development goals, this was their entry point to securing the hardware they needed to succeed, of which there is a finite supply.

Nebius plans to house 35,000 GPU's upon completion of the KC facility (20,000 by year end), utilizing the latest and incredibly efficient NVIDIA H200 GPUs

Alongside this, their facility in Finland is getting an overhaul and expansion, and a new facility will be constructed in Paris.

This is early days, P/S incredibly low in the peer group, which is insane considering the ridiculous multiples on all of the other shit doing nothing in this space. Industry trends are a massive tail wind. If they stay true to growth projections it's only a matter of time before it balloons, and Q1 is an excellent test of their reliance and ability to meet targets.

They received their first buy rating today from some garage shop trying to play wallstreet dress-up, but institutional money is going to be eyeing this closely, and they have an added advantage of their global footprint for managers looking to reposition this far into the secular bull.

As far as revenue goes, they reported $43 million in Q3 2024. They anticipate ARR to surpass $700 mil by year end. If we want to keep valuations reasonable relative to peers, this company should be valued well above 15 billion by year end, making a $65 share price entirely reasonable as the market plays catch-up.

KODAK will prosper under the new US Administration,"I read this post by user Adventurous Date a couple months back:

""Kodak now has 1.4 Billion in cash after they sold the excess from the pension. They only have 400 million in debt.

I got curious and called Kodak Investor Relations to ask what they will do with the money, and what their main source of revenue was. He told me they have no current plans to use the cash, and that their primary source of revenue was commercial printing but might soon be eclipsed by their Advanced Materials and Chemicals sector. He then said that they will roll out some new sources of revenue in 2025 that the market would react well to. Now you're gonna have to Trust Me Bro on that one because I did not record the phone call. 

Now we all know the Orange Man loves Kodak, he loaned them $765 million during his first administration (https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/28/896209016/trump-gives-medical-stockpile-a-kodak-moment-with-new-loan-to-make-drugs) and he loves all things ""old Timey"" so you know he loves this:

With all of this in mind, I bought 400 shares of KODK at $6.55 and I am hoping for some sort of boost from the Orange Guy, or the new product rollout, or their use of the 1.4 Billion in cash. Their stock peaked at $7.74 a few weeks after the announcement that they had 1.4 Billion in cash, and is currently at $6.38.

 NVO Novo Nordisk A/S is trading at a discount.,"While some might think of juicy burgers and crunchy chicken tendies when reading 'discount', it is actually Novo trading at a discount. Since the crazy market overreaction to Novo's latest GLP-1 drug study results, it has become evident, that Novo Nordisk is heavily undervalued.

While Novo can do better communicating the results of the REDEFINE trial (press release on 20th of Dec. 2024) and the study design itself (flexible protocol), Novos care for heavy guys and gals is heart melting. The drugs are good. One might even go to the cops for being robbed of their pounds so fast:  
Cagrisema showed superior performance, outdoing monotherapy of both Semaglutide or Cagrilintide significantly.

The December Dump: Weight loss was reported in percent, instead of change in the BMI and BFP. Test subjects assigned could choose their own dosage (patient-friendly flexible protocol) and weren't administered accordingly to individual medical stats.

Quote NVO: ""The REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial. After 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg.

When evaluating the effects of treatment if all people adhered to treatment1, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks compared to a reduction of 11.8% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg, 16.1% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 2.3% with placebo alone.""

While the stock took a record single day hit, Novo Nordisk sales and future sales regarding weight loss drugs are only to rise further.

The market and the margins are just as massive as the people about to receive prescription of Cagrisema. Cagrisema is a subcutaneous injection, once per week. Insurance companies are pickung up on the trend to treat very well fed folks with GLP-1 drugs, as it's the easiest, safest and most cost effective way to care for obese people. Obesity causes manny comorbidities, and overweight people make up for vast majority of health insurer spending. Health insurance expenditures didn‚Äôt went up all while increasing spending in the weightloss and obesity care sector. So increasing efforts effectively in obesity care will only win insurers clients.

BULLISH. If in doubt just ask yourself, if there is the reason not to have a snack, if you can loose roughly a fifth of your bodyweight in less than 1.5 years.

EDIT and updates regarding some comments and recent published news:

'Tariff man‚Äò Novo Nordisk has just bought factories for USD16.5 B of Catalent in the US This comes as an answer to the high demand for weight loss drugs, but will bypass any tariffs by Mango man.

Catalent deal Catalent has been a contractor for Novo Nordisk and has now been acquired for USD16.5B USD11B for three medical drug manufacturing facilities. NVO is increasing it‚Äòs US foothold to fulfill the high demand. Bullish.

Medicare price negotiations:  
Prices for 15 drugs, which are proven effective will be included in the US-Medicare price negotiations, cause they are considered expensive.  
That's two more years high yield of Ozempic. Meanwhile demand stays high.

High-Dosage Ozempic grants 20.7% loss of overall bodyweight.  
No need for a new FDA approval, just triple the recommended dose of 2.4mg Semaglutide. Results of this study with n=1,407 Patients will be published during this year.

'Ozempic-cliff-off' Ozempic is patented until 2031. NVO develops another GLP-1 for sure.

Meanwhile Cagrisema is entering the market. (22.7% bodyweight reduction over 68 weeks)

So Cagrisema is basically a combination of Semaglutide (GLP-1 analogon) Cagrilintide, an insulin cosynergetic peptide. Cagrilintide, which is long acting synthetic version and analogon of Amylin, basically slowing down digestion and dampening the Glucose spikes (and then crashing) and thus reduce Insulin secretion. While doing so it offsets insulin resistance. Patients feel noticably less hungry, which is a big part in weight loss.

Cagrisema not only achieves tremendous weight loss, it's also a very managable weight loss for patients. The Combination of Semaglutide and Cagrilintide itself is a formulation. Pharmaceutical patents are granted for new, useful, and non-obvious inventions - it's NVOs new money printer. It's safe, it's easy, Insurers love it and it will Make Adipose Guys/Gals Anneal that fat off."
$PLUG PlugPower could ROCKET this week on DOE Loan confirmation [Must Read DD],"Plug Power is a leading company in the hydrogen fuel cell industry. They are arguably the most ""legit"" hydrogen play with over 150 patents and Walmart and Amazon partnerships. However this isn't about the company long term. **It's about $1.6B coming there way any day now from a DOE Loan.**

First the setup. A huge amount‚Äî25%‚Äîof their shares have been sold without first being owned *if you know what I mean*. ""Non-owner sellers"" think the company will die with the Trump admin coming in and that this loan won't get through before his inaguration.

However that's not shaping up to be true. The market cap is 2.4 billion. They are about to receive $1.6B from the Department of Energy. Why am I confident this will occur?

1. Biden is [rushing to push through DOE loans](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Bidens-Transition-Loan-Rush-Hits-38-Billion.html) before Trump takes office on Jan 20th and has done $38B so far
2. The PlugPower CEO has ***literally*** said they are just crossing t's and dotting Is, and that there is a high probability the loan is [confirmed this week](https://renewablesnow.com/news/interview-plugs-ceo-confident-about-loan-deal-and-future-under-trump-1269142/?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1736528144)
3. There was a report that the DOE [website updated PlugPower's page](https://hntrbrk.com/plug-power-2/) on Friday, with a history of updating pages a 2-3 business days before loans closes are announced and on weekdays. 
4. This means if it were to come before Trump it would be announced this week as he takes office next Monday.
5. Additionally, the company has said it might bring another equity investor on board after the loan closes, which might likely be one of its partners (Amazon or Walmart). This would be another positive ""surprise"".

This loan is at an insanely low interest rate for such a risky company of 5.5% per year. I have no view on the long term viability of the company, and frankly I don't care at all. But this is the best imaginable news for the equity. It's as if they raised 1.6B of free money without dilution which would be *unheard of*. This is again like 70% of the market cap.

*It means that ""non-owner sellers"" no longer can rely on offerings to buy shares.* 

This is a loan, so they will pay it back, but it essentially gives this company a massive lifeline and would likely cause a scramble for shares and the interest rate is only 5.5% which is essentially equivalent to what the company can get by investing the money into T-bills, so it's ""free money"" (though of course they may use it to run operations).

When the loan was first announced, the stock jumped 20% and it has since sold off 40% from there on fears the loan wouldn't get through before Trump. A lot could change this week!

"These puts could be 20 Baggers. Turn $1,000 into $20,000","I want to keep this DD super simple. $DJT, Trump's ""tech"" company where he owns a controlling stake called Trump Media & Technology Group. Everyone knowns their financials are a dumpster fire, and the company has NEVER traded based on any real value or earnings. Seriously, take a glance at them. This is purely a game of selling to the greatest fool, and we all know it. If you just look at the chart, it's glaringly obvious: the stock spikes wildly on hype, then crashes back down. Let's take a look at what fueled these unsustainable pumps in the recent past:

Jun 27th 2024: First Presidential debate with Trump / Biden - Stock went up 50% THEN COLLAPSED.

Jul 12th 2024: Trump got shot, the stock pumped 30% and then COLLAPSED and slowly bled out.

Oct 28th 2024: Trump MSG rally with Elon's support. Stock spiked 50% THEN COLLAPSED.

The final catalyst, and what could be the mother of all sell-offs, is the Inauguration happening on Jan 20th (next week). It'll be a major event, sure, but once the news cycle moves on, the hype will evaporate faster than a fart in the wind. With the current valuation completely detached from reality, $DJT is primed for a massive correction. The selling pressure will build as people race to close, as we've seen time and time again with this turd. Now, the risk here is that $DJT somehow keeps pumping to around $50 or so, but then that means puts will be even more profitable. This ticker has been pumped and dumped so many times, it's hard for it to get erect at this point. That said, my current (yes, small) position is below:

EIX is responsible for burning down an entire neighborhood,"Hello All,

First and foremost - my condolences to all those who are effected by the wildfires in Los Angeles.  It's truly a terrible situation, and as you will see, a completely preventable one.

On the night of Tuesday, January 7th, Los Angeles experienced historical winds reaching in excess of 80 mph.  During that night there were a few fires that started and quickly spread, the Palisades fire and the Eaton Canyon Fire.  We will be focusing on the latter.

Southern California Edison (ticker symbol EIX) is the main power provider for the Altadena, Pasadena, and many other Southern California neighborhoods.  As you can read in this thread -- [https://www.reddit.com/r/pasadena/comments/1hynfjr/who\_was\_responsible\_for\_the\_eaton\_canyon\_fire/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pasadena/comments/1hynfjr/who_was_responsible_for_the_eaton_canyon_fire/)

They were servicing the Altadena neighborhood near Eaton Canyon and during that night they said that they turned off the power lines, when in fact, many neighborhoods reported that they still had electricity right before the power went off and even after.

I will also submit to you this video from a survivor of the fire -- [https://www.reddit.com/r/pasadena/comments/1hzdlo8/have\_you\_all\_seen\_this\_how\_eaton\_fire\_started/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pasadena/comments/1hzdlo8/have_you_all_seen_this_how_eaton_fire_started/)

Which clearly shows that the fire started underneath a power line station.

Given the historic precedence for these fires (both Hawaiian Electric (HE) for the Laihana fire and Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) for the Camp fire).  I believe that Edison will be found responsible and liable for the Eaton Canyon fire and the rising death toll (up to 24 at this time).

Yes they have dropped - but I believe they will continue to drop.  The PCG settlement for the Camp Fire literally bankrupted PCG and cost them $13.5B -- [https://www.wattstrialfirm.com/powerful-results/historic-13-billion-pge-wildfire-settlemen/](https://www.wattstrialfirm.com/powerful-results/historic-13-billion-pge-wildfire-settlemen/)

I can see a similar settlement being reached by Edison before the end of year - which would bring their market cap down significantly from the current level of 23B to somewhere in the range of 10-15B which would represent a stock price of around \~$38 conservatively

Also like I said - this is a horrible tragedy and the only reason I don't feel guilty about making money off it is because these companies end up just increasing rates to pay their fines.  No one loses out but the current shareholders, there is never corporate responsibility or punishment for these greedy companies that put shareholder profit above safety.

"These calls could be 100 Baggers. Turn $1,000 into $100,000","Okay, so everyone remembers me when I gave you the 500 bagger play on $DJT in March and everyone made a ton of money. I also gave the $DJT play in Jan and in Sep 2024. Well we're back one final time.

I want to keep this DD super simple. $DJT is Trump's tech company he owns like 60% of called Trump Media & Technology Group. Everyone knows their earnings are shit but the company has NEVER traded based on earnings. The stock has been trading for 4 years now (first as DWAC now as DJT). If you look at the chart over the past 4 years the stock basically trades flat but has these insane 100% - 300% pumps for a week and then falls again. Let's look at what caused these insane run ups in the past.

* Nov 2022: Trump announces he was running for President - **Stock went up 100% in a week**
* Jan 2024: Trump wins Iowa Primary - **Stock went up 300% in a week**
* Jun 2024: First Presidential debate with Trump / Biden - **Stock went up 60% in a week**
* Sep/Oct 2024: Presidential Election run-up - **Stock went up 400% in a couple weeks**

The final play in my opinion is the Inauguration happening **Jan 20th** (next week). It's going to be the biggest event in the world that day, everyone's going to be there and Trump will officially be President of the United States. I believe $DJT is going to have an insane run-up starting on Monday (we were green Friday even though the market was blood red). My positions are below:

https://preview.redd.it/mlu0pd9u0fce1.png?width=2398&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c4527ea0b5890466b23df7c0580ed5b2fedecde

**Positions:** Shares and OTM calls. I believe the Inauguration run-up will start Monday. I could be wrong, but if I am wrong, this will be the first time there's a major event with Trump that $DJT did NOT run up. So I am 95% sure I'll be right."
"$RGTI needs to come clean on revenue sources, or Jensen is right","Hey all,

It's your favorite RGTI short story teller.

Below is the shortest short thesis I wrote on RGTI a week a go and made 10X on my puts.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hsszsq/rgti\_management\_sold\_at\_2\_giving\_us\_the\_shortest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hsszsq/rgti_management_sold_at_2_giving_us_the_shortest/)

Here is the main issue with RGTI - they are not issuing a release saying Jensen is full of it. Why is that?

All they need to do is answer these questions:

**1. How much of their revenue is grant money from DARPA** **or other governmental agencies?**

**2. How much of their grant money from DARPA or other governmental agencies has been ""earned"" and how much is a true grant which will be collected whether they complete milestones or not?**

**3. How much of their revenues are from quantum hardware that they themselves have produced and commercialized?**

[https://www.google.com/search?q=Rigetti+Computing+receives+a+DARPA+grant](https://www.google.com/search?q=Rigetti+Computing+receives+a+DARPA+grant)

I bet that we will not hear any of these answers from RGTI any time soon.

Disclosure: I own RGTI puts which I will add trim, or close out as I see fit.

EDIT: Fumbled today's puts and closed the call spread, so I only own the $7 for next week. Need a 30% drop to be ATM, but given the legal investigations and short sellers getting activated, next week might prove interesting. My position in the $7 puts is twice as large as was my $15 put position last week. I will trade more as I deem appropriate.

**EDIT: sold the 7 puts for this week at 1.44 which is about 6X. tomorrow the CEO is speaking so I did not want to risk the irrational market taking something out of context. If I were there these 3 would be my main questions, in addition to "" ""Why the hell did you sell stock at $2?"" but I will not be there. more trades are coming shortly either this week or next.**

"
Is Qatari Sheikh planning to take over Papa John‚Äôs?,"Papa Johns has been dishing shitty pizza and shittier returns for a long time now

 

But it looks like it caught the eye of a Qatari sheikh who just created a hedge fund with a strategic partner who has the experience and intention to take PZZA private or at least shake things up

 

Some hedge fund called Irth Capital Management LP filed their first and so far only [13F on January 2nd](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2046144/000149315225000031/0001493152-25-000031-index.htm) disclosing a massive new position in PZZA. During the fourth quarter of 2024, and most likely only after November for reasons I'll explain below, Irth bought 1,628,503 shares in PZZA for $66,882,618. Irth now owns 4.99% of PZZA

 

But who is behind Irth Capital Management LP? According to Irth's offering [Form ADV and Part 2A of Form ADV](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/330696), Irth is a money manager formed on November 14, 2024. Irth has over $202 million AUM from only 4 clients

 

Pulling from Irth's Part 2A, their stated investment objective and strategy include the following:

 

* Irth implements a systematic, event driven, fundamental constructivist investment strategy, investing in both public and private companies. Irth focuses its research primarily on areas where it has deep domain expertise and long-term relationships such as: Food and Agriculture, Consumer Goods, **Restaurants**, Leisure, Hospitality, Supply Chain Logistics, Government, Data, and Technology.

 

* Irth‚Äôs investment decisions reflect Irth‚Äôs core principles: concentration, deep fundamental research, and **control**.

 

* Irth‚Äôs Strategic Fund generally consists of 8-15 core, event driven, long only positions.

 

Irth discloses in their Part 2A that their *private equity investments **will often originate as an investment on the public equity side**; therefore, Irth creates many of its own opportunities and does so at what it believes to be attractive valuations. Once a **public-to-private** sale process begins, Irth has an information and speed advantage given that it has already been researching the company, its industry, customers, and competitors for months, sometimes years.*

 

Irth makes it clear that they are active, not passive, investors in their Part 2A: *Irth‚Äôs investment philosophy is based on the active management of the reorganization process of its portfolio companies and influencing and directing the post-reorganization business strategy, management and operations of its portfolio companies.*

 

So what we know so far is Irth was formed in November 2024 with $202 million from 4 investors with a mandate to either take public companies private or engage in shareholder activism. We also know that almost immediately after forming their fund, Irth took a nearly 5% and $67 million position in PZZA which happens to be in Irth's target industries. Irth's $67 million position in PZZA represents almost one-third of their entire AUM which is quite a YOLO

 

But who really is Irth and why am I talking about a Qatari sheikh?

 

Irth was co-founded by two people: [Matthew Bradshaw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-bradshaw-1011617/) and [Sheikh Mohamed bin Abdulla Al Thani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheikh-mohamed-bin-abdulla-al-thani-133663341/)

 

Matthew Bradshaw is formerly the founder and managing partner of Durational Capital Management which took Bojangles private in 2019

 

Sheikh Mohamed bin Abdulla Al Thani is a Qatari sheikh who was most recently the CEO the Qatari sovereign wealth fund's Americas group

 

If it's good enough for a Qatari sheikh to YOLO, it's good enough for me to YOLO. I'm in for 1,000 shares at an average basis of $39.59 - screenshot is attached

Rumors of HUMA's demise are greatly exaggerated,"This DD on HUMA requires the reader to be a bit off mentally. So I couldn't think of a better stage than this dumpster fire of a sub (behind Wendy's). After rimming the $10 level this summer, the stock has settled under $5 despite [FDA approval.](https://investors.humacyte.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humacyte-announces-fda-approval-symvesstm-acellular-tissue) Some say FDA approval was more than priced-in, but what's important is to look at how the stock got here from $10 and what the company's prospects look like in comparison to its Enterprise Value and cash runway.

First, wtf is HUMA? They are the only FDA-approved, commercial-scale manufacturer of universally implantable human tissue. In five weeks their product is ready for shipment, [according to the CEO](https://investors.humacyte.com/events/event-details/piper-sandler-36th-annual-healthcare-conference). The first FDA approval they got on December 19, 2024 is for Vascular Trauma. They expect FDA approval for more indications this year and next. [Peak sales projection](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818382/000121390021009958/ea135854ex99-2_alphahealth.htm) is $12 billion for current late-stage pipeline products. TAM is $150 billion. The median price to sales ratio for biotech firms producing biological implants is [14.7](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1d5wjpt/huma_dd_yolo_is_there_still_room_to_grow_after_a/) and biotech generally is 7.14. Either way, this is potentially a micro-cap to large-cap story.

[Two more indications in stage 3](https://preview.redd.it/dba8jsx14ece1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bbf620105823abe0f1db7c619d76d9efc72e28c)

Why then, is it trading at an almost 200% yield to the average analyst [estimate](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HUMA/analysis/)? This part is a cluster fuck, but bear with me as I simplify it into four points. First the CEO Laura Niklason and her husband and HUMA board member Brady Dougan jointly seemed to [sell](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HUMA/insider-transactions/) a huge chunk of shares since summer. However, notes to the [filings](https://humacyte.gcs-web.com/node/9691/html) state that the husband needed liquidity for the troubles with his other company, Exos Financial. Basically, dude's a banker who started his own bank and effectively got margin called. He's ""special"" just like us!

Second, within just a few days of their first large sale, the number of shares short in the stock went way up and it continued to rise 607% after the FDA delayed its decision to approve HUMA's first indication on August 10, 2024:

[Number of shares short up 607&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/wuuj9hpy2ece1.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=5eb39ac779cf46caecb7d38a6e95fe9636625fa5)

To make matters worse, Martin Shkreli revealed he is short on HUMA via [X](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1841148167758196801) and youtube, but published no detailed rationale. He just said he trusted the research of a guy he found (more on this later). A lot of traders respect his take on stocks and bio tech, so he has high credibility to influence them to join him in shorting it. The 12 month mark passed with no FDA decision on December 11, 2024 for HUMA's BLA submission for their first indication.

On December 17, 2024 a short seller published a convincing and highly technical short [report](https://x.com/anthonystaj/status/1869146356893544814) arguing that the FDA would reject the BLA for the first indication and that HUMA would soon after run out of cash and die. I speculate that this is the guy Shkreli mentioned. Funnily enough, the FDA [approved](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/humacyte-announces-fda-approval-symvess-034700671.html) HUMA's SYMVESS on December 19, 2024.

So they did what any sensible trader would do. They dug their heels in and married their short positions. Martin Shkreli [asked](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1869958965037281611) people to short the FDA pop. This was soon after his success shorting $SAVA so a lot more people joined in to create a shorting frenzy. Even though the stock was up 45% in the middle of trading day, out-of-the-money puts were up over [10,000%](https://x.com/BizJewish/status/1870152818058797154).

The crux of their argument is that HUMA's FDA approval for SYMVESS is useless, because it's too expensive and provides too little additional benefit over competitor products per clinical trail metrics. What they refuse to accept is that there is still a great business case for SYMVESS. They also argue that HUMA's future products will not be FDA approved due to clinical trial issues.

HUMA's tech was praised by the Department of Defense (DoD) in a [report](https://blastinjuryresearch.health.mil/assets/docs/acute_treatment/fy16/extremity_injury/TissueEngineered_Vascular_Grafts.pdf) they published in 2016. In fact, they've issued $7m in grants to HUMA and were key in pushing for FDA approval via Public Law [115-92](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/medical-countermeasure-collaborations/fdadod-collaborations). The DoD explains in that report above: ""IED wounds are always ‚Äúdirty‚Äù, and bacteria in the wound can colonize the synthetic graft, causing abscesses and sepsis, therefore there is a need for \[an\] alternative \[like SYMVESS\] \[...\] The \[SYMVESS\] grafts are also self-healing making them amenable to the frequent re-cannulation required for \[Hemodialysis\]."" Such benefits do not show up in the clinical trial data.

These benefits are a crucial differentiator though. Plastic and cow grafts are not recognized by the human body as part of itself. However, SYMVESS and other HUMA products make the body think and act like it's repairing itself as usual, because the material is real human tissue. The body populates it with its own cells. That's why they have never had a single episode of [rejection](https://x.com/humacyte/status/1696175066818453518?s=09). Zero rejections across several clinical trials involving hundreds of patients. Rejections are insanely expensive and they happen with plastic and cow grafts.

Zero rejections is the main advantage of SYMVESS and it is completely ignored by the shorts. The CEO of the company [explains](https://x.com/humacyte/status/1696175066818453518), ""We've implanted hundreds of patients inside the US and outside the US, and we've never had a single episode of rejection."" So synthetic grafts can be made to have similar data with modern medications that prevent clotting and infections, but there are immeasurable long-term benefits to using actual human tissue populated by the patient's own cells.

This is why countless surgeons with decades of experience love HUMA's tech:

""I am most excited about the promise that Symvess holds for the long-term experience of our patients. I hope that, with Symvess, the 19-year-old patient with vascular reconstruction after trauma will no longer spend the six decades after their surgery anticipating disaster, but that their chances for reintervention will be no different than if they had autologous conduit.‚Äù

\- Dr. Rishi Kundi, a clinical investigator at the University of Maryland Medical System

I won't bore you with quotes but here's a few names to Google if you want their thoughts on SYMVESS:

Dr. Michael C., the chief of vascular surgery at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School

Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA‚Äôs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research

Dr. Nicole Verdun, director of the Office of Therapeutic Products at FDA‚Äôs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research

Charles J. Fox, MD, FACS, Director of Vascular Surgery, University of Maryland Capital Region

Ernest E. Moore, MD, FACS, Director of Research, Ernest E. Moore Shock Trauma Center at Denver Health

HUMA's next indication due for approval is dialysis, where again the clinical trail data seems comparable, but the CEO explained the main advantage in response to an analyst question, ""One of the Chief Medical Officers from Fresenius \[our dialysis partner\] joined us at the post-presentation lunch after ASN and his biggest comment and what he said mattered most to him, because he oversees a lot of the provision of care at dialysis centers is a decrease in catheter time and exposure in terms of reimbursement for the services Fresenius provides is huge for them.""

Obviously you could argue the advantages being outside the scope of clinical trials make FDA approval an uphill battle for HUMA's future indications, but that's where DoD backing via Public Law 115-92 comes in to push through FDA hurdles. It was during Trump's first administration that DoD financially backed HUMA in 2017, so the incoming administration is on board. Physicians and hospital administrators already see the nuanced healthcare and business advantages.

Sales to DoD are a given at this point. In that 2016 report, they state, ""These \[SYMVESS grafts\] can be shipped to hospitals and field locations, and can be stored until needed."" Meaning DoD will stockpile not just for battle readiness worldwide, but also for the Strategic National Stockpile and domestic trauma centers. Shelf life is 18 months so they will restock and provide recurring revenue.

Sales to healthcare customers are not difficult, because it's intuitively better vs plastic, cow, or risky and time-consuming traditional vein grafts. It's more expensive, but it's easy for the healthcare customers to understand how it can save a lot more money on unnecessary autologous vein procedures and in the long-run due to rejections of plastic or cow vein substitutes.

Yes SYMVESS  got a black box warning from FDA due to rare thrombosis (clotting) and rupture risks that their competitor products don't have. But a lot of FDA approved stuff has black label warnings. Some examples: Ozempic, Altace, Wegovy, Celebrex, Fortamet, Paxil, Prozac, Warfarin, Pradaxa, etc. What's more, the final [FDA report ](https://www.fda.gov/media/185033/download?attachment=&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)on SYMVESS approval contains only one restriction for its use vs three restrictions for the current standard-of-care fistula.

This won't inhibit sales one bit. According to [a vascular surgeon](https://x.com/medtechmd/status/1878071426931957806), ""there has been no innovation in this indication for decades,"" and SYMVESS is likely to be used off-label in all areas of the body, because of the risks and added procedure cost with Saphenous Vein harvest. SYMVESS is way more predictable and off-the-shelf, according the same surgeon. The major long-term advantages, high praise from the medical community, and an unusual [press release](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-acellular-tissue-engineered-vessel-treat-vascular-trauma-extremities) by the FDA itself that expressed excitement about the approval confirm this.

""The total lifetime health-care cost projected for patients undergoing amputation ($509,275) was more than three times higher than that for patients undergoing reconstruction ($163,282)."" - [Health-Care Costs Associated with Amputation or Reconstruction of a Limb-Threatening Injury](https://journals.lww.com/jbjsjournal/fulltext/2007/08000/health_care_costs_associated_with_amputation_or.3.aspx)

Plastic and cow vein graft substitutes have a much higher rate of amputation. Also the autologous vein method requires a whole another procedure to extract a section of vein from another place in the body. The cost of another procedure is way higher than SYMVESS. $25k is chump change in comparison.

On the balance-sheet front, HUMA has no debt and a tiny lease liability. Other liabilities are non-cash (royalties). No production reason to need cash, unless sales are great. Five weeks to relabel and ship thousands of grafts on-hand. Just received a $40m milestone investment due to FDA approval. Plus they raised $45m in Q4 and will get another $50m this year if they sell 1,187 units (out of 26,000 potential) of SYMVESS. That's more than enough cash for all of 2025, so no dilution in sight.

The forest vs trees analogy on HUMA is that you have a company fighting to establish a synthetic human tissue platform for 20 years. They have strategically overcome many forms of crisis without taking on any debt, and just got de-risked via FDA approval. It's a terrible short with 30% SI, and a great long as a micro-cap to large-cap story.

Meta ‚≠êÔ∏è5,"Playing the TikTok ban. Posting for the 4th time‚Ä¶.
  
¬•\~Previous Events  
  
=They posted beautiful numbers during earnings but Mark started talking about bad AI numbers and the market panicked a bit.   
=The market was digesting Meta's insane comeback anyway. They need something big to impress outside of expected large ad numbers.   
= 3-0 unanimous decision by an appeals court decision to uphold Tiktok ban in December 
  
¬•\~Present   
  
What about if one of their competitors vanishes overnight? We are playing the TikTok ban. This canon event is being heavily discounted.  
  
It's down to nine people after that it cannot be changed. Trump submitted the amicus brief as this will be the last chance he could stop the ban without getting into some serious issues with his chosen board and Congress with both sides supporting the bill. With everything else that's on his plate, I believe Trump will call a spade a spade and will look into it and say he tried. He's already got the election win from Tiktok he doesn't need it as much and with Zuck now onside he can still push what he needs to push. The moves.   
  
This is down to nine people and how they see national security. I've read up on the defense and prosecution legal appeals from before the original appeals trial (160 pages) and the US DOJ has an incredibly strong case, which is why the appeals court voted 3-0.   
  
Each judge has a different view on amendments and their importance vs national security however we can base from the previous judges arguments that this is quite open and shut as three judges reached the same conclusion with two judges differing on the interpretation but arriving at the same conclusion.  
  
If this goes through...it will get bigger than the initial 10% gain with the appeals decision. It will create a rally at which point there'll be many spots to take profit. The longer this ban stays in place the more of a rally Meta will gain (Snapchat, Google, possibly Reddit, too) but we bet on the big horse first.  
  
The ad dollars on offer are gonna get carved up like a prize beast and these ad companies are going to add the spoils to their market cap.  
  
Here are my estimates for possible results based on everything with 5-4 enough to uphold the ban.  
  
5-4 Stay/Strike down  
5-4 Uphold   
6-3 Uphold   
7-2 Uphold  
  
My prediction: 6-3 Uphold   
  
¬•\~Future - Guidance/Event  
  
Facebook delivered great numbers and good guidance except for AI comments. However, this quarter they'll be carving up a big slice of the ad pie.   
  
Creatives: So quick admission I used to work in social advertising years ago and the creatives as they are known are the images and videos used for a digital advert and they come locked into certain aspect ratios and formats. This means companies that have locked in months of creatives from agencies will have to move their TikTok ads somewhere the format works. Snap, Google, and of course Meta (Big Horse)  
  
Facebook's ad budget: Is going to swell and we all know that the catalyst will be continuing the rally when they announce earnings in Early February.   
  
¬•\~Key Dates = January 10th, January 19th, January 20th  
  
¬•\~Risks to thesis = Ban does not go through - This is a binary event, the probabilities are high that it will go through but it is always possible it does not.
  
¬•\~Checks = Last appeals decision Meta went up 10% in the lead-up to the appeals decision although this was not the final decision so this has the potential to rise further.  
  
¬•\~Long-term potential = Once the vote goes through will re-up and hold medium/longer-term options.

Moderna (MRNA) upside potential,"Lots of bad news in 2024 crashed the stock from its high of 166$ (May 2024) namely:
1) Declining covid-19 vaccine sales
2) Revised business outlook for long term about sales
3) R&D cuts and loss of investor confidence
4) RFK Jr running HHS (vaccine denial)
5) News of one vaccine side effects in elderly

Current price: 45$ (near 52 week low)
All time high: 385$ (2021)

I am no investment expert but I feel the stock is oversold (my gut says so)

Reasons I believe for decent upside potential:
1) HMPV virus cases in China and slowly popping in other countries will cause some panic in the upcoming months leading to vaccine developments potentially
2) Bad handling of health crisis and vaccine denial of the upcoming administration will lead to outbreaks
3) Moderna is also developing some cancer vaccines and combinations vaccines
4) Potential for breakthroughs in medicine and good news
5) How much more can it go down?

The current U.S. stock market valuation has reached 2000 and 2021 levels.  Will this time be different?,"Three different U.S. stock market valuation models (the Buffett Indicator, CAPE ratio, and Mean Reversion Model - three different ways of objectively looking at the overall valuation of the current market) are flashing extreme overvaluation warning signs that were both last seen in 2000 and 2021.  Both 2000 and 2021 marked market euphoria highs, and bear markets followed.  You can make all your jokes that you want about gay bears successfully calling 420 of the last 69 recessions or what not, but the undeniable fact is that the track record of these three valuation models showing ""strongly overvalued"" in unison is 2 for 2 in ""calling"" bear markets that followed very quickly.  Will history repeat itself again?  Or is this time different (i.e. - valuations continue to ""not matter"" for longer)?

There is also a fourth model - the Interest Rate Model, which measures S&P 500 valuation relative to current 10-year treasury rate.  It hasn't quite hit the ""strongly overvalued"" line (it didn't in 2021 either), but it is pretty close to it.

[Interest Rate Model - Not quite to the \\""strongly overvalued\\"" red line, but close.  Lower than it was in 2000, but higher than it was in 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/32sl4e1o4abe1.jpg?width=1660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dedfffde7edc549734c8c0747c3e3356ceba79bb)

Two recession risk models - Yield Curve Inversion and the Sahm Rule - may be signaling a rough time as well.

[Yield Curve - The 10-Year to 3-Month treasury spread, after big and long inversion, looks like it may be uninverting now.  Historically, recessions or bear markets followed soon after the uninversion.](https://preview.redd.it/iuek8qe66abe1.jpg?width=1651&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b11f04747d4069dc6305dbe7d8a631243308b2b8)

\-

[Sahm Rule value - a measure of the current 3-month moving average of unemployment compared to the prior 12-month low of that same stat.  It poked just above the red line, then retreated a bit.  Right now it is kind of in \\""Will it or won't it?\\"" mode.](https://preview.redd.it/hjkkkzdt8abe1.jpg?width=1673&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0151bc58c63c00c2c482642dc2df0f2be53e2173)

\-

There is also the Fed Funds Rate. It is showing a similar setup to previous cycles of rate hikes, followed by rate holds, followed by rate cuts, followed by recession.  The current setup looks similar to 2007-2008 especially.  Will the recession or bear market be cancelled this time with ""mission accomplished - soft landing achieved""?

[Fed Funds Rate - 2007-2008 looks pretty similar to now.](https://preview.redd.it/1w999tosaabe1.jpg?width=1715&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f016a2cda57106d33d7f0b85e303a8199bdb4d6f)

Here is the inflation-adjusted S&P 500 on a log scale chart.  It has historically gone through a series of ""hot"" periods where the market beats inflation for roughly 15 years (give or take a few years), followed by ""cold"" periods where the market loses to inflation that last 10 years (give or take a few years).  The magnitude and time length of the current ""hot"" period looks like it could be giving way to a ""cold"" period soon if the overall historical cycle is followed.

[Inflation adjusted S&P 500 - Are we entering a cooling period soon?](https://preview.redd.it/p82of78idabe1.jpg?width=977&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da3a49111a2c512564846f330f2053baaa628f2c)

Last but not least, I'll list a few informal ""Can't you just feel it it in the room?"" type ""blow-off top"" indicators of a potential market top:

1. Tesla stock doubled in price in like 1-2 months on shallow narratives not backed by numbers.  An insane $750 billion market cap to an even more insane $1.5 trillion market cap in 1-2 months on a company earning roughly $13 billion annually (132 P/E ratio right now) and not growing much anymore.  Ludicrous.  Earnings have not exploded in line with stock price, not nearly at all.  I don't care what you TSLA lovers say - your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth.
2. Palantir stock also doubled in price in like 1-2 months, also on shallow narratives not backed by numbers.  Roughly $100 billion to $180 billion market cap with a price-to-SALES ratio going from an insane 30x to an even more insane 67x.  Ludicrous.  And I don't care what you PLTR lovers say - your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth.
3. *\[Removing this point from discussion because AutoMod thought I was breaking rule #8, even though I wasn't.  I pasted it down in the comments section* [*HERE*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hv91vx/comment/m5ssco9/)*.\]*
4. Just the mentality of too many market participants buying ponzi-scheme like assets or money-burning trash companies at all in general, often knowingly.  Like, seriously, why is this even a thing?  What the fuck is wrong with this market?  This shouldn't be happening... like, at all.
5. The great momentum chase of 2024. The theme of the year was to just bid up and crowd into the most popular meme-like line-go-up assets, regardless of fundamentals.  It went into over-drive in November/December, to the point of self-parody.  It has a very end-stage bull market feeling to it.
6. The great AI hype.  Does the potential future of AI justify many of these extreme valuations?  Maybe, but I'm not convinced that there's much upside left near-term.  The only companies making serious money from this so far are Nvidia and the handful of companies selling the AI hardware to other companies that are speculating on it.  And the once rapid progression in generative AI chatbots, picture generators, and video generators seen in 2023 and early 2024 seems to have slowed and hit a bit of a wall in the second half of 2024.

TL;DR - All the warning signs of extreme overvaluation and an incoming bear market are there.  Unlike most other gay bear posts that usually just show one ""warning sign"" chart to make a case, I showed you multiple charts, along with multiple observations.  Whether you choose to ignore them or not depends on how long you think the market will choose to ignore them or not.

Positions: (1) Bent over a table.  (2) Puts on TSLA, PLTR, MSTR, and some other 2024 momentum clown stocks for 2025. Contemplating whether to inverse or to inverse my inverse.

Update: 1/7 Pre-market - I have taken down the screenshot of my tentative positions from 1/6, because I will be closing some of them and changing some things around.  For archival purposes, you may view my original 1/6 positions [here](https://i.imgur.com/J0orM1x.jpeg).

Update: 1/6 7:00PM EST - Cramer on his closing segment on ""Mad Money"" just said ""I think Palantir and Tesla stock are DEFINITELY going higher.""  Take that for what you will.  I know the meme is to inverse Cramer, but he does end up being right short-term a number of times, so it doesn't really make me any more confident in my puts."
2025 Options Mispricing,"4-14 day OTM call options on US indexes will be mispriced in 2025 due to market under pricing Trump effect.

The heat map shows % movement of SPY over time last year. SPY moved >2% 23 times over 3 days and 34 times over 4 days. c10% of trading days.

So we could buy an option every day or wait only for low IV weekly entries and we will print huge gains overall - selling when IV is high after a 2% bump is easy gains.

"""New"" Volkswagen Leaks ","Alright degenerates, strap in because this is why Volkswagen might just be the juiciest short of 2025. Spoiler alert: this makes Dieselgate look like a warmup.

My Position: Just opened a -0,4 Delta 80‚Ç¨ put on Volkswagen (Vz.) for 5000 ‚Ç¨ expiring 19th June 26.

The Chaos Computer Club just (27.12.24) just revealed that Volkswagen (and its subsidiaries Audi, Seat, Skoda) exposed the real-time locations of *800,000 EVs*. That's right ‚Äì anyone with basic skills could pinpoint where your $40k EV is parked, plus grab your name and contact info. VW literally left their cars and customers wide open for anyone to exploit. Volkswagen‚Äôs software arm, Cariad, stored all this sensitive data on Amazon Web Services without proper encryption or safeguards. Let me say that again: **no encryption in 2025.** That's amateur hour for a company that sells millions of cars. Oh, and this isn‚Äôt the first time VW screwed the pooch on tech; their software track record is *garbage.*

*Here is the link to their video:* [*https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-wir-wissen-wo-dein-auto-steht-volksdaten-von-volkswagen#l=eng&t=0*](https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-wir-wissen-wo-dein-auto-steht-volksdaten-von-volkswagen#l=eng&t=0)

**Why This Is Bigger Than Dieselgate**  
Dieselgate cost Volkswagen over $30 billion in fines, lawsuits, and buybacks. But that was *emissions*. This? This is **personal data** ‚Äì names, locations, potential stalking targets and members of the BND. We‚Äôre living in the post-GDPR era, where the EU doesn‚Äôt play nice with data breaches. Fines for mishandling data can be as high as 4% of annual global turnover, which for VW could mean billions. Plus, the reputational damage.

**There has not yet been a Market reaction to the release of this video.**

Also want to give you some reasons why you should not take my advice and short VW:

* Volkswagen is the biggest EV player in Europe with about 25% market share. European people don‚Äôt trust Chinese vehicles, and they don‚Äôt trust Elon Musk.
* VW is grossly undervalued compared to Tesla. We‚Äôre talking ‚Ç¨44 billion market cap vs. ‚Ç¨1,279 billion for Tesla. VW currently earns those ‚Ç¨44 billion every four years.
* CCC did responsible disclosure, and VW already fixed the breach. It will be hard to prove harm done to you.
* The German state is highly invested in VW
* EU regulations require automakers to collect and process vast amounts of data to comply with emissions standards, safety protocols, and EV monitoring. The breach highlights shortcomings, but some responsibility lies with the regulatory framework.

¬†**Q3 2024 Highlights**¬†

* Revenue of $6.8 billion. 18% increase YoY.
* Gross profit of $3.4 billion. 24% increase YoY.
* Operating income of $724 million. 223% increase YoY.

¬†**Q3 2024 By Segment**

Data Center -¬†

Net revenue of $3.5 billion. 122% increase YoY.

Operating income of $1.04 billion. 240% increase YoY.

Client -

Net revenue of $1.88 billion. 29% increase YoY.

**Data Center Growth**¬†\- This is AMD‚Äôs fastest growing segment and accounts for roughly 50% of all revenue. This number is going to continue its rapid rise due to key acquisitions and product innovation. Lisa Su estimates the market for data center AI accelerators to grow at a CAGR of 60% until the year 2028. That would value the market at $500 billion for things like CPUs, GPU‚Äôs, FPGA‚Äôs, and ASIC‚Äôs. Obviously, Nvidia currently dominates the market. Despite this, there is room for multiple players and AMD has shown their ability to capture market share. In 2022, they surpassed Intel in both market value and annual revenue, positioning themselves as the clear number two player in the market. I've said it before with companies like Palantir, data is the future and every company needs it. Well in order for a company to have data, you need chips. Everything needs chips. We are still in a small and juvenile market that has massive amounts of room to grow.

**Acquisition of ZT Systems** \- Announced in August 2024, AMD will acquire ZT Systems for $4.9 billion. The deal is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2025. ZT specializes in designing and deploying data center AI computing and storage solutions. This shows the focus and commitment AMD has to their fastest growing segment.¬†

**Strong Belief in Lisa Su -** Lisa Su is an amazing CEO with a strong desire for excellency. After becoming CEO in 2014, she has completely turned around the company and continues to improve it.¬†Here is a great video to watch of her - [https://youtu.be/8Ve5SAFPYZ8](https://youtu.be/8Ve5SAFPYZ8)

**Conclusion** \- AMD is gaining significant amounts of market share for data centers, a trend that will continue as the market grows. Despite declines in the gaming and embedded segments, the company overall continues to grow revenues. The decline in gaming looks alarming but it makes sense. New gen consoles came out 4 years ago which AMD supplies chips for. Regardless, what I‚Äôm focused on here is the data center growth. AMD is innovative and managed extremely well which can be seen by continuously improving operating margins and FCF. This company will continue to become a monster.¬†At a current price of **$125,** I expect this to easily get back to **$200+** in 2025 giving a solid 60% upside."
NVDA,"Jensen Huang, that fucking genius, has turned NVIDIA into the goddamn stock you need to bet your fucking life savings on for the next hundred fucking years. This motherfucker has the vision of a goddamn prophet, dragging NVIDIA from just making sweet-ass gaming GPUs to dominating AI, data centers, and even that self-driving car bullshit. His balls-to-the-wall leadership style, where he encourages his team to take massive fucking risks, while wearing that same leather jacket like a goddamn uniform, has created a culture where innovation fucking thrives. With his strategic expansions into every high margin tech sector under the fucking sun making NVIDIA's market cap soar, this dude has made it clear that NVIDIA isn't just a tech giant; it's the fucking future. Jensen thrives on destroying competition by being a market maker and not a share taker (AMD).  So, if you're looking for where to shove your money, you better shove it up NVIDIA's ass because Jensen Huang is the real deal.

RGTI management sold at $2 giving us the shortest short thesis you will ever read,"Management diluted at $2 in late November.

The market did not care, and pumped it to $20 for no reason other than mass mania/hysteria.

Management will most likely dilute again, but not much above $2, unless it does an at-the-money death spiral offering which will cause the funding institution to short the stock.

Speaking of management, a lot of them sold their stock as soon as it ran up in November, starting at $1.3 and with most sales completed under $5. There is a pretty sad Benzinga article asking rather rhetorically whether RGTI management missed the quantum importance or their company valuation. To that I say - grow a spine and call it what it is - management never underestimates the value of their own company by a factor of 10. If anything, management overestimates it and tries to sell shares at a premium, not a 90% discount.

RGTI's downfall is inevitable, no matter what technology they own. Insiders know what stock they own and where they work, otherwise they would not sell their hard earned shares below $5.

Disclosure: I own $15 puts for next Friday, looking to add more as time passes.

PT: $30 by the summer. It might be too late to get in when their next earnings report hits in February.

# Company Overview

**Founded:**¬†2007  
**Headquarters:**¬†New York City, New York, USA  
**Industry:**¬†Advertising Technology, Digital Marketing  
**Ticker Symbol:**¬†ZETA (NYSE)  
**Market Cap:**¬†$3.5B (as of January 2025)

# Financial Performance

Zeta Global's financial trajectory has been impressive in recent years, though it operates in a competitive and capital-intensive industry. Key financials for the most recent fiscal year (2023):

* **Revenue:**¬†$1.1B (2023, up 22% YoY)
* **Gross Profit Margin:**¬†60%+
* **Net Income (Loss):**¬†\-$5 million (2023)
* **Free Cash Flow:**¬†Positive in 2023, signaling strong operational efficiency and future growth potential.
* **EBITDA Margin:**¬†\~8%

The company is not yet consistently profitable on a net income basis, but it has demonstrated a strong ability to scale its SaaS platform, improve margins, and reduce operating costs over time.

**Key Metrics:**

* **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR):**¬†$700M (2023)
* **Customer Retention Rate:**¬†90%+
* **Client Base:**¬†Over 1,200 enterprise clients
* **Churn Rate:**¬†Low (3% annually)

# Business Model

Zeta Global operates primarily as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform offering a combination of data, analytics, and machine learning models. Its core offerings include:

* **Zeta Marketing Platform:**¬†An AI-powered marketing automation platform used for customer acquisition and retention, personalized digital marketing, and omnichannel advertising.
* **Zeta Data Cloud:**¬†A data-driven solution that uses first-party data, third-party data, and behavioral insights to provide deep customer segmentation and predictive analytics.
* **Omnichannel Advertising:**¬†The company enables businesses to target customers across multiple digital channels, including social media, email, display ads, and more.

Its customers span various industries, including retail, healthcare, automotive, finance, and telecommunications. Zeta is primarily focused on providing solutions for enterprise clients, large-scale advertisers, and direct-to-consumer brands.

# Key Strengths

1. **Robust AI and Data Science Capabilities:**¬†Zeta's advanced machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics help clients make data-driven decisions and optimize their marketing spend. The ability to collect, clean, and analyze large volumes of data is a strong competitive advantage in the digital marketing sector.
2. **Extensive Consumer Data Network:**¬†Zeta has built a massive first-party data network with more than 250 million consumer profiles across 60 million households in the U.S., which gives it a significant edge in targeting the right audience with personalized, high-conversion ads.
3. **Comprehensive Marketing Platform:**¬†Unlike many competitors that specialize in one specific area (e.g., email marketing, paid search), Zeta offers an integrated platform that covers the entire marketing lifecycle from acquisition to retention, making it a one-stop shop for marketers.
4. **Solid Customer Base & Partnerships:**¬†Zeta counts large, established brands as clients, including major Fortune 500 companies. This provides credibility and financial stability. The company's revenue growth has been driven by strong partnerships, especially with clients in sectors like retail and e-commerce.
5. **Recent Acquisitions:**¬†Zeta has expanded its product offerings and market share through strategic acquisitions, including its purchase of LiveIntent, which provides valuable consumer data and sales leads to marketers. This has bolstered its data-driven offerings and solidified its position as a leading martech company.

# Competitive Landscape

The digital marketing space is highly competitive, with several prominent players offering similar solutions. Zeta Global competes with both traditional advertising agencies and newer marketing technology companies, including:

* **The Trade Desk (TTD):**¬†A major player in programmatic advertising and real-time bidding.
* **Salesforce Marketing Cloud:**¬†A well-established SaaS platform in the customer relationship management (CRM) space with strong marketing tools.
* **Adobe Experience Cloud:**¬†Known for its creative and marketing analytics tools, it competes directly with Zeta in terms of marketing automation.
* **Oracle Marketing Cloud:**¬†A suite of marketing tools, including data management, email marketing, and content targeting.
* **Criteo (CRTO):**¬†A competitor in the programmatic and performance marketing space.

Zeta differentiates itself with its focus on AI and first-party data. The company's proprietary data network and customer insights give it a unique edge over competitors relying on third-party data sources, especially as privacy concerns and regulations (like GDPR and CCPA) shape the digital marketing industry.

# Risks

1. **Profitability Concerns:**¬†Although revenue growth has been strong, Zeta is not consistently profitable, and investors will need to monitor how the company navigates its path to sustained profitability. Operating in the low-margin advertising technology sector can limit earnings, especially during periods of market contraction or advertising budget cuts.
2. **Data Privacy Regulations:**¬†As a data-driven company, Zeta faces regulatory challenges surrounding consumer data privacy and the evolving landscape of data laws like GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California. Compliance costs and operational disruptions could impact margins and client relationships.
3. **Economic Sensitivity:**¬†Advertising spend is often one of the first areas that businesses cut during economic downturns. If the broader economy experiences a slowdown, Zeta's revenue growth could be negatively impacted.
4. **Intense Competition:**¬†The digital marketing industry is crowded, with both established players and startups vying for market share. Zeta's ability to maintain its leadership position will depend on its capacity for continuous innovation, scaling operations, and retaining clients.
5. **Integration of Acquisitions:**¬†The company's recent acquisitions, including LiveIntent, pose integration risks. Zeta must ensure that these acquisitions add value and don't become liabilities due to cultural differences, operational challenges, or market overlap.

# Growth Strategy & Outlook

Zeta Global's growth strategy is focused on:

* **Expanding its customer base**, particularly in high-growth sectors like e-commerce, healthcare, and financial services.
* **Enhancing AI capabilities**¬†to further improve customer targeting and marketing effectiveness, making its platform even more indispensable to marketers.
* **International Expansion**: The company has a growing presence in international markets, particularly in Europe and Asia, where its solutions are becoming more popular.
* **Leveraging Acquisitions**¬†to add data assets and expand its product suite. The integration of LiveIntent is expected to yield strong results, particularly in terms of data-driven lead generation.
* **Investing in Product Innovation**¬†to maintain its competitive edge, particularly in the areas of customer segmentation, cross-channel marketing, and analytics.

# Valuation & Investment Considerations

As of January 2025, Zeta's market capitalization is approximately¬†**$3.5 billion**¬†with a P/S (Price-to-Sales) ratio of around¬†**3.2x**, which is reasonable for a growing SaaS company. However, it is important to note that the company is still in the early stages of profitability, and its valuation might be somewhat speculative, with future success hinging on scaling its product offerings and achieving sustained profitability.

**Potential Catalysts:**

* Strong quarterly earnings reports, showing improved profitability and cash flow.
* Successful integration of recent acquisitions, leading to increased revenue and margin expansion.
* Expansion of international operations, particularly in high-growth markets.
* Positive developments in AI and machine learning technology that further enhance the marketing platform's capabilities.

# Conclusion

Zeta Global represents a compelling opportunity in the martech and advertising technology space, especially for investors looking for exposure to AI-driven marketing and big data. The company's growth potential is significant, given its strong client base, advanced technology, and expanding product offerings. However, risks related to profitability, competition, and regulatory challenges should be closely monitored.

Zeta is an interesting investment for those who are willing to take on the risks associated with its growth trajectory and the competitive digital marketing sector. Investors may want to keep a close eye on the company's path to profitability and how it navigates external challenges like data privacy regulations and market fluctuations."
"$KULR is massively overvalued because of a deceitful CEO. The DD no one asked for.
","What is KULR's core business model exactly? Providing battery thermal safety solutions, licensing fan AI software that helps suppress vibrations? Selling safe cases for batteries? Or maybe it's the recently announced BTC treasury? Wrong! None of the above. KULR's money making strategy... is to milk YOU! The unsuspecting, highly regarded ""investor"".

And what makes me say that, you ask? Many hours of research spent on New Year that I will detail in this post (yes, I had nothing better to do).

Let's begin by introducing Michael Mo, the CEO and founder of KULR. He did a¬†[reddit AmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/o6iboh/i_am_michael_mo_ceo_of_kulr_technology_our/)¬†right after KULR was listed on the NYSE in 2021, what a nice fellow.  
And right there marks the beginning of a deceitful strategy:

*Heavily embellish accomplishments*,¬†*announce big name ""partners"" or ""collaborators"", whilst obfuscating what the relationship is really about, or what the accomplishment actually is.*

https://preview.redd.it/yxqbg56n8mae1.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=f906d5b6cb11703fc7db1d3ad99cef09516e738f

Surely he has a lot to say and can explain their partnership with Andretti Autosports? Well, no not really:

https://preview.redd.it/us679crs8mae1.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=035443f54cac579a2cc6b0a70e1a15392b4d3e06

What an insightful answer by our CEO Michael Mo!

According¬†[to Andretti](https://andrettiglobal.com/news/2022/10/kulr-technology-group-returns-to-andretti-autosport-for-indianapolis-500-with-marco-andretti/), KULR was their primary sponsor for their INDYCAR program. Even after thorough research, nothing seems to indicate KULR was at any point developing or providing their technology to or in collaboration with Andretti.

Surely Mr. Mo wouldn't lie about that, while KULR was actually just sponsoring Andretti in a marketing deal??

I quickly realized, as I deep dived on KULR's announced accomplishments, partnerships and collaborations, that my research painted a much different story every single time.

https://preview.redd.it/e3wvlunw8mae1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7f34ddbf4a7e8ed7239620962e9afd3cfb62b47

What an impressive list of big name ""Customers"" and ""Partners"" listed in the latest investor presentation! Makes you wonder how they only barely hit 10 Million annual revenue with so many ""Key Clients"". Of course, Mr. Mo never actually goes into detail about who the clients are and what is being sold to them.

Fortunately, I have a lot of time on my hands so let's go into some of those supposed customers and partners.

For many of these companies, I could not find a SINGLE source of information linking them to KULR in any way.

**NASA**

KULR sure do like to mention NASA a lot when talking about their biggest accomplishments. Let's dive into those.

https://preview.redd.it/ip5ioic49mae1.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3d6e5c24aff8ad1d17521f22ca3b4dd967b7b68

In 2019, Leidos was awarded a contract by NASA to help bring supplies to the ISS. Leidos decided to use KULR's technology to... \*drumrolls\* safely store laptop batteries next to each other. KULR storage bags that ensure one of them overheating doesn't overheat the ones next to it.

What else?

In 2020, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, funded by NASA, was in charge of SHERLOC, an analysis instrument, for the upcoming Mars rover mission. The laboratory chose KULR's heatsinks to ensure the lasers and sensors wouldn't overheat. Unfortunately, the SHERLOC instrument ran into technical issues when the rover was deployed on Mars.

In July 2024, KULR landed a battery safety contract for $400k worth up to $2 Million with NASA, for automated battery cell testing. Not bad, but not very noteworthy either when you look at KULR's current $1 Billion market cap.

**SpaceX**

Name dropping SpaceX as a ""partner"" is a straight up lie.

KULR will, for the first time ever, in **2026**, have their battery in space on a nanosatellite. It will launch via a deal with ""Exo-launch"", on a SpaceX Rideshare mission (a low cost launching service that allows shared cost for multiple satellites/customers).

KULR is a CUSTOMER of SpaceX. It seems Mr. Mo has a habit of confusing, ""being a customer of"", and ""being partners with"", a company. Am I a partner of Wendy's when I buy chicken tendies? no.

Mr. Mo does it again with Molicel, which is also listed as a ""customer or partner"", when all they do is supply KULR with battery cells.

**So does KULR have any actual customers??**

Well, yes. A few that are hard to identify. One of them is Viridi Parente. Viridi signed a multi-million, three year contract in 2021 with KULR for their battery thermal safety tech in the development of a stationary energy storage system. Even though KULR communicate a lot to their investors, it's unclear if this partnership with Viridi will be ongoing and grow in the future.

Remember when I mentioned fan AI tech? KULR have been wanting in on the AI and NVIDIA hypetrain this year, so they've been developing an AI using NVIDIA's jetson, to help reduce fan vibrations, and capitalize on the growing amount of AI data centers that use fans. What does it have to do with battery thermal safety tech? Absolutely nothing, but it sure helps drive the stock price up, especially after announcing their sole licensing deal with a mysterious Japanese customer for $1 Million.

Sure makes you wonder, if KULR had a patented top of the line space-ready battery safety technology that could be mass-produced, why would they dedicate resources to developing a completely different technology, when they have a grand total of 57 employees and 2 open positions.

**Then how does KULR make money and stay afloat?**

That's where Mr. Mo hopes you and I come in! Since KULR has never been profitable, and will remain that way for the foreseeable future as they are no where near any sort of mass commercialization for any product, KULR relies on ATM offerings to generate cash, diluting shareholders in the process. The higher the stock price, the more cash they can get from the offerings.

Did I mention Mr. Mo suddenly had this great idea for KULR to become a BTC treasury? What an amazing excuse to dilute shareholders even more while the stock is massively overvalued, despite them not needing any more cash!

[KULR outstanding shares](https://preview.redd.it/gbg8hcq89mae1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=44d669ecd722e4c0850aa3dcf248e008b08b5834)

**Conclusion, TLDR:**

KULR is massively overvalued, whilst having no plan or guidance for any sort of significant revenue increase that would justify a $1 Billion valuation. Instead of focusing on one product/technology, KULR diversifies itself to try and grab as much market attention to drive its stock price up and dilute shareholders. KULR CEO makes up fake ""partnerships"" with big name companies, deceiving investors.

I'm short $3000 since today at 3.67. Not financial advice.

I will tattoo KULR on my forehead and post it here if my position isn't in the green by the end of the year.

SolarEdge DD - My bet on SEDG,"**Overview:**  
SolarEdge is a photovoltaic (*PV*)¬†*i*nverter and solar energy company.  
The company has seen a meteoric rise and subsequent downfall within the past 5 years.

https://preview.redd.it/0gnxj53xakae1.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=42ce8c04973f28b7cce3b38430cc903a75ef5e7e

**To summarize the events leading up to this:**  
A growing market demand for PV inverter systems, together with a growing market share of SEDG in that sector, led to consistently increased earnings over several years, from 300mil quarterly revenue in 2020 to 900mil quarterly revenue in 2023, which skyrocketed the stock price.

Mismanagement of market conditions led to an equally devastating crash.  
Management was not able to foresee decline in sales and purchasing due to rising inflation and corona virus market recession. It aggressively expanded its factories, acquisitions, and employees, leading to a significant increase in company expenses.  
Meanwhile quarterly revenue dropped from 990m to 715m to 316m in the next 2 quarters.

All solar energy companies were hit by a big decrease in revenue, and a stock pile of unsold products.  
This was especially painful for Solaredge which aggressively expanded, unable to see the forthcoming recession in solar market.

https://preview.redd.it/aqseg3tkekae1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=44429395651bbd5cd32353fd0409f41122fcb79c

**My Analysis:**

**Risks:**  
Solaredge $350m bond due end of 2025  
Solardge negative income for the past 5 quarters.  
Trump policies may rollback subsidies and rules favor solar energy sector  
Stock is volatile and many gains are shorted lived. Combined with a negative outlook for stocks in January, will see a difficult time in stock price to go up.

**Pros:**  
Solaredge revenue has been stable at around $260m for the past 3 quarters.  
The only thing required for the company to become profitable is to cut expenses.

Over the past year, Solaredge has taken many cost-cutting measures, including headcount and facility reductions.

**My belief is that Solaredge will turn profitable in 2025q1 (february), or at the latest 2025q2.**  
**Share value will double in 2025, because the company trading much lower than it's fair market value, and many open hedge position.**

**Positive indicators:**

1. SolarEdge insider trading is up, and board members have been buying shares since November. Independent Chairman,¬†*Avery More*, recently bought a whopping $1.1m worth of stock, at a price of $13.65.
2. Most recent target price set by Goldman Sachs, on Dec 20th, double upgraded SolarEdge (SEDG) to Buy from Sell with a $19 target price. (Todays SEDG price is $13.60)
3. SolarEdge has taken many cost reduction measures in the past year.
4. SolarEdge is currently hiring new employees in R&D departments. This is a strong indication the company feels financially secure about its future.
5. Solaredge is rumored to have another round of layoffs in non R&D departments - another indicator of increasing efficiency and reducing operating expenses.
6. Sale of ¬ß45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credits in consideration for approximately $40 million, will provide liquidity and strengthen solaredge cash position.
7. The company forecasts fourth-quarter 2024 revenues of $180 million to $200 million. Given the revenue of the past 4 quarters (260m on average), as seen in chart above, the company should be able to beat expectations on it's upcoming quarterly report.

**TLDR:**  
Solaredge is traded at half it's fair market value.  
Solaredge has reduced expenses significantly, and is very likely to return to profitability in the next two quarters of 2025.  


**Final notes:**  
Assume everything I have said is inaccurate. Do the research for yourself.  
Don't take this as financial advice. The stock can go up today 10% and down 20% tomorrow.  
The company is still at a very volatile point, and waiting for a profitable quarter before investing is the safe thing to do.

**YOLO** My entire portfolio into SEDG:

Sable Offshore Corp upcoming catalyst and value play $SOC,"There's a pretty good trade going on over at the value investing sub and would like to share another user's DD. It stems on Oil and Gas company re opening an existing site. this is a good one for a few reasons but go ahead and take a look below. I know this area where the Santa Ynez project is and am familiar with operation. trust me bro. my position is 150 shares at $23.84 . credit goes to BJJblue34 :

""I've been working on this for a few days, and I wanted to share.

Background: Santa Ynez Unit was an asset owned and operated by Exxon since the late 1960s, and was Exxon's most productive US asset producing between 10-20 million barrels of oil per year at a low cost of production of about $16 a barrel. Exxon was forced to shut down production since June 2015 due to a pipeline leak of 2,400 barrels of oil into the Pacific Ocean (Exxon Valdez was 10 million gallons for comparison). Exxon was unable to resume production due to California regulations. Basically, California was requiring Exxon not only to have its Santa Ynez Unit compliant with California law, but every asset worldwide complaint. This was a non-starter with Exxon which forced them to exit California operations much like other large-scale oil companies like Chevron, Phillips 66, and Occidental Petroleum. This is where Sable comes in. Sable purchased ExxonMobil‚Äôs Santa Ynez Unit assets for $883 million for pennies on the dollar, with a net asset value of $10B. Sable has since made considerable regulatory progress and is expected to begin hydrotesting the Pipeline in January 2025 in advance of a potential restart of production in q1 2025. Sable must pass a Federal court ordered consent decree which which includes granting of waivers by the Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) which has outlined 6 steps for Sable to complete before being able to start operations. Per OSFM, Sable is now on steps 5 and 6 which are deferred maintenance and a startup plan which OSFM has provided a detailed outline for anyone interested. Sable initially met obstacles from Santa Barbara County but settled with Sable to avoid a lawsuit due to loss of income which could bankrupt the county. California State Fire Marshal Daniel Berlant approved a key pipeline-corrosion-control plan submitted by the Sable Offshore oil company on December 17. The approval by the fire marshal starts begins a 60-day review by a federal hazardous materials agency. If the agency has no objections, the waiver will take effect in mid-February.

Further, the California State Lands Commission is currently processing applications to reassign four leases in state waters from ExxonMobil, the previous owner of the Santa Ynez Unit (SYU), to Sable. State Lands has no timeline in mind for this decision, said Sheri Pemberton, their spokesperson; however, the SYU may restart without these lease assignments.

Asset: Santa Ynez Unit is three offshore platforms located in Federal waters north of Santa Barbara, California with 112 wells (90 producers, 12 injectors, 10 idle); in shallow water of 900-1200ft. Sable has a substantial resource base with 646 million barrels equivalent of oil and a net asset value of $10B.

Thesis:

Ownership thinks it can bring production up to at least 10 million barrels in 2025 (28,000 barrels a day), and production up to 20 million barrels a year by 2028 while having minimal long term capital expenditures of about $150M per year. With improvements in drilling technology over the past decade production could possibly be up to 30 million barrels a year. With oil priced at $70/b, 10 million barrels of oil would imply annual free cash flow of $400 million and potentially up to $1.2B of cash flow based on increased production capacity on $70/b oil. This is a cash flow yield ranging between 20-63% given the current market cap is $2.0B and an enterprise value of $2.5B.

California oil production currently stands at 283,000 barrels per day, so Sable would be a moderate boost to California supply which currently still gets most of its oil from Middle East suppliers along with Canada and Alaska due to consumption of >4 million barrels per day. Given California's increasing reliance on foreign oil (will also lose a lot from Alaska in the next couple years) a supplier in state is becoming increasingly necessary. Furthermore, Sable is operating under 16 federal offshore leases. California has limited jurisdiction. With a pro-oil production administration coming into office, this should provide further assistance toward operational success.

Management plans to institute aggressive shareholder return program: ‚Äí Target fixed quarterly dividend of $1/share with a $2.50/share upside ‚Äí Opportunistically repurchase shares with excess cash ‚Äí Maintain conservative leverage profile by aggressively paying down debt

Buffett and Munger's thesis on Occidental Petroleum is investing in a business with known large oil reserves (in the case of Occidental their reserves in Permain Basin), having minimal capex, and returning maximum cash flows to shareholders. Most oil companies don't operate this way historically. However, Occidental and now Sable are focused on limiting capex and returning maximum value to shareholders.

Chairman/CEO: James C. Flores is the CEO and Chairman of Sable Offshore: -Leading Flores & Rucks, Inc. in 1994 -Chairman and CEO of Plains Resources Inc. in 2001 -Chairman, CEO, and President of PXP, which was acquired by Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. in 2013 -Vice Chairman of FCX and Chairman and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC until April 2016

Flores has extensive experience in the industry and his family spent their own money to own approximately 20% of the company, so they have a huge incentive for the success of this business.

Current balance sheet: 288M cash 344M in current assets

259M in warrant liabilities 814M Senior Secured Term Loan 1.3B in total liabilities

Valuation:

Bear case: If production is not resumed by January 1, 2026, the terms of the asset acquisition with ExxonMobil Corporation would potentially result in the assets being reverted to ExxonMobil Corporation without any compensation to Sable which would be a large loss of capital.

Base case: $400M in annual free cash flow ($70/b oil on a conservative 10 billion barrels annually and $15/b costs) for a $4 billion valuation, a doubling of current valuation.

Bull case $1.65 billion in annual free cash flow ($100/b oil on 30m barrels annually with 10/b costs) x 14PE for a $37.5B valuation, possible a nearly 20x if everything goes right.

Risks:

1. Regulatory hurdles. While significant progress has been made, Sable has still not officially cleared regulatory hurdles required to begin operation.
2. California political environment. There is a reason oil companies abandoned California. There is a known hostility toward the fossil fuel industry.
3. Sable is leveraged to the price of oil. A global drop in oil prices could severely hurt cash flows.
4. Ownership execution. While management is experienced in the G&E sector, they still have no track record with Santa Ynez.

Catalyst:

1. Clearing regulation is the single biggest hurdles. If Sable can begin operations, this company probably goes up >50% to >$30/share.
2. Proving operations. If management can deliver on their expectations of $1/quarter dividend then the stock should be >$40/share which is almost a double.""

MVST is heavily undervalued based on DCF analysis.,"Microvast Holdings $MVST üöÄ 

Following the last earnings call, Microvast Holdings ($MVST) has not just held steady but has shown signs of robust momentum, indicating a compelling narrative for future growth and market dominance. Here are the facts that underlying my conviction:

1. Record Revenue and Profitability:
- The company reported a record quarterly revenue, showcasing a significant year-over-year increase. This financial performance marks a pivotal moment, as it's the first time $MVST has entered profitability, demonstrating not only growth but also operational efficiency.
> $101.4 million of revenue were reported in Q3, a 26.6% YoY increase, net income stood at $13.2 million.

2. Gross Margin Improvement:
- There was a notable improvement in gross margins, which is a clear indicator of Microvast's ability to scale its operations while controlling costs. This margin expansion is expected to continue as the company leverages its growing market presence.
> Their gross margin increased to 33.2% in Q324.

3. Strong Cash Position:
- With substantial cash reserves, Microvast is in a solid position to fund further growth initiatives, including R&D, expansion of production capabilities, and strategic acquisitions that could widen its market reach. As of Q324 cash and short term investments stood at $104mn.

4. Expansion and New Ventures:
- The company has plans for enhancing its production capacity, particularly at its Huzhou facility, and is actively expanding in the U.S. commercial vehicle segment. The anticipated financing for the Clarksville facility could further amplify its production scale, leading to increased market share.

5. Guidance for Future Revenue:
- Microvast has provided optimistic guidance for the next quarter and the year, projecting significant revenue growth. This confidence in future earnings is backed by current contracts and a growing order book, suggesting a strong demand trajectory. Revenue guidance for Q4 > $90-$95 million. If profitability continues, expect a significant re-rating of the stock.

6. Analyst Optimism:
- Post-earnings, analysts have been adjusting their price targets upward, reflecting optimism about Microvast's growth potential. The stock's valuation, when compared to peers or based on future revenue projections, suggests there‚Äôs room for further appreciation.

8. Investor Sentiment:
- The market's response post-earnings, with the stock touching a 52-week high, reflects strong investor confidence. The stock's performance, combined with low short interest and a significant volume increase, shows that both retail and institutional investors are betting on its upward trajectory.

9. Valuation:

Based on Q3 2024 financial results, annualised, this provides a revenue value of 355m and based on industry context for valuing companies, it is to be between 5-10x .
Therefore, 5 x 335m is 1.775 billion USD 
300m shares o/s gives a share value of 5.92 
 
When looking at PE, with a PE ratio of 25x, this comes to 1.325 billion USD, giving a share value of 4.42 
 
Estimated discounted cash flow value (DCF) is ranging between 5-6.50 per share 
 
Therefore, just purely based on the current financials, the stock is heavily undervalued.

I am heavily invested in MVST and you should too as this gem is undervalued as hell. Easy 10x from current price.

$GSAT: The Overlooked Satellite Company With Extraterrestrial Potential,"**TLDR: Globalstar‚Äôs outsized role in Low-Earth Orbit communications and recent equity partnership with Apple will provide substantial future cash flows and support rapid growth. Price target is $5, but will very likely extend far above this valuation.**  


Globalstar ($GSAT) provides Mobile Satellite Services through its satellite constellations worldwide. More specifically, they provide cellular data and enable cellular communication, satellite monitoring of ground assets by governments, emergency service to remote areas, and utilization of their frequency spectrums authorized by the FCC and ITU (most importantly).¬†

[Globalstar recognizes revenue from its Spectrums under the ‚ÄúWholesale capacity services‚Äù segment, and its respective 51&#37; and 31&#37; increases for the 3\/9 month periods ending in 2024 compared to 2023 illustrates its importance as a driver of operating profits.](https://preview.redd.it/7aitpeu2ug9e1.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=79a85edf5fb76472b8c076573edd6d8861479b5c)

[Revenue has been steadily increasing, even through rocky macroeconomics](https://preview.redd.it/o1b7g5ecug9e1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=be6fa6c5d32200883db22aff0379bde53bbb2e96)

Authorizations for ownership of terrestrial spectrums are often lengthy endeavors and require a demonstration of competence by any company seeking them. The fact that Globalstar has secured L-band and S-band spectrum authorizations gives it a massive competitive advantage and access to a wider variety of international populations and markets than competitors.



In addition to this competitive advantage, Apple recently initiated a 20% stake in the company and provided them with $1.1 billion in funding (paid in quarterly installments) to pay down debts and for use of their services. This 20% equity stake emphasizes that Apple views Globalstar as a company with significant growth potential rather than a simple operating partner.¬†



And it‚Äôs not just Apple buying in either‚Ä¶  


https://preview.redd.it/k0m4nv9mug9e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ad21bd9dc33f91d8cf73c39078fa1488521138c

Institutional ownership of Globalstar is up across the board, with names like JPMorgan and Fidelity rebalancing their investments and taking stakes outright.

I believe that Globalstar‚Äôs current undervaluation is due to its historic balance sheet weakness and continued share dilution. However, the $1.1B in funding from Apple provides it with a solid runway and cushion from debt.¬†

More recently, they filed to effect a reverse stock split. This split would address their ongoing share dilution issues, provide additional liquidity for lot trading (blocks of 100 shares that benefit from lower commissions and fees), and a path to NASDAQ listing.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/hoitjsrrug9e1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=23efe4b77ce65b23157ee66bea04ab4a273b129c

I believe that this company‚Äôs valuation currently reflects outdated historic data, and is not priced appropriately given these most recent developments. The consensus price target is currently set at $5, but having been beaten down for nearly 2 decades, I would expect any spark to ignite a rally that extends far above this target."
üö®Bag-holder DD alert: QuantumScape ALL IN üö®,"How are YOU going to generate your after holiday blues? Assuming you are a well balanced individual... Well I am going to do it by losing my coat in QuantumScape. The ticker might be banned even though market cap is 3b+? Anyway...

I am not all in on QuantumScape because they have the special ""Q"" word in the name, although that is part of it... They don't do anything in quantum, but they have made a quantum leap in battery technology that could revolutionize the Electric vehicle industry.

Electric vehicles are the darling of the market, and they will remain so with Mango man in office. Flying cars are now taking to the stage. They all need this better battery solution that QuantumScape offers. QuantumScape's projected revenue is expected to absolutely skyrocket in the next couple of years. It is undervalued for a revolutionary technology that will earn major revenue within a 5 year horizon.

I am not going to bore you with fake financials from a pre-revenue company - although they are pretty well capitalized. This play is purely on technology and hype.

QuantumScape, with their leap in technology, can generate the hype it once did in 2021. In 2025, it is much closer to producing it's technology at scale for Electric vehicle partners around the world. The market will remember soon.

I always hear people ask ""how did you know to buy this"" and ""how did you catch this before it ran?""

It's all about timing and being present on the internet, with a dash of the right kind of regarded.

Energy is next. You can see all of the battery names running up in the last month. Their market caps are still low, and they will go much higher. My main problem is that I don't know where QuantumScape stopsüöÄ.

* **Volkswagen Partnership:** QuantumScape has entered into an agreement with Volkswagen's battery unit, PowerCo, to mass-produce solid-state batteries. This deal grants PowerCo a license to produce up to 40 giga watt hours annually using QuantumScape‚Äôs technology, enough to power around one million vehicles.
* **Technological Milestones:** The company has initiated the production of its B-sample cells, a new generation of solid-state batteries for electric vehicles, which could revolutionize the market with higher energy density and faster charging times.
* **Solid-State Battery Market Growth:** The global market for solid-state batteries is expected to experience significant growth, driven by the increasing demand for electric vehicles and advancements in battery technology.
* **Competitive Edge:** QuantumScape's proprietary technology positions it favorably against competitors, potentially capturing a substantial market share as the industry evolves.

"Why $BROS shouldn't come before hoes - A Bear Case DD.
","Listen up regards, ive been going to $BROS since 2017 back when they only had 1 branch in a small college town in Colorado and seen them expand across the entire state over a few years. Yes i know ‚Äúthe lines are always long‚Äù yeah ‚Äúthey‚Äôre competing with starbucks ‚Äú yap yap yeah they got the lisa su of coffee in christine barone as the new CEO but shut it and hear me out. I'm gonna tell you why this company is gonna fk up your grandma's inheritance way quicker than you can count to Gee Em EE (yes im throwing shade at our beloved regards at super stonk). If you genuinely bought that stock that shall not be named, you should actually buy BROS since you've likely been donating to the market for years anyway¬†

**Less Blondes, More ‚ÄúWTF is that thing that took my order?‚Äù**

When I first started going to Dutch Bros, every morning was basically a softcore caffeine porno. 10/10 baristas smiling at you, making your day less miserable before you go back to being a wage cuck at whatever bs remote job you do. Now I show up and I‚Äôm greeted by some purple haired thing named Skylar. The amount of rainbow employees i've been seeing at different locations has made me gag, If I genuinely wanted a questionable gender-fluid experience, I‚Äôd just invest in coins again. Now I just go to $SBUX to get served by underpaid but a cute WOMAN. idc what you say, you can‚Äôt put a P/E on ‚Äúno boner, no brew.‚Äù¬†

**Healthier Options = Brain Activity = Lost Sales**¬†

look, I go to Dutch Bros because I want 500 grams of sugar in a single gulp. I‚Äôm not here to think about the caloric content of my caramel macchi-whatever-the-fuck. Studies (these are harvard studies if you cucks wanna try and question me) show that when you force customers to think, you lose money. Give me my diabetes-in-a-cup and let me die happy. Also who the fuck buys a protein coffee, get a grip .

**Competition is Thiccker than a Nikola motors truck**¬†

Expansion is a bitch when you‚Äôre trying to out-coffee Starbucks, Dunkin‚Äô, and every bearded hipster in a food truck. You really think $BROS can find prime corners in big cities when SBUX has already claimed every intersection and half the alleyways? Good luck with that. They might as well set up shop in the middle of bumfuck iowa at least they‚Äôll have a monopoly there.

**Real Estate: From Tiny Shacks to Big-Ass Buildings**

The beauty of Dutch Bros was their huts‚Äîlittle shacks that cost roughly the same as an average tiny 3d printed home. Now I‚Äôm seeing thicker stores with actual indoor/outdoor seating, meaning sky-high overhead.¬†

If you're regarded: More real estate = more capital expenses = less margin. you start letting customers inside, and guess what? They might linger, think about what they‚Äôre buying and worst of all might even realize they can just make their own coffee at home like a finance guru on¬† youtube

**Expansion Costs & Financial Fuckery**

Yea yea $BROS wants to open 1,500 stores in the next decade. Each new location can cost up to \~$1M in capex (im sure ur all have finance degrees and know what this means). With an average check size that barely pays your rent (assuming you ever move out of your mom‚Äôs basement) or even covers a 3d printed house , that‚Äôs a metric shit-ton of $9 coffees just to break even.Meanwhile, $SBUX is sitting on every corner, flexing their global supply chain and brand recognition. And where are the profits?? Last quarter, $BROS had a net loss of around $16 million while ‚Äúexpanding.‚Äù Their operating margin makes my match rate on hinge look good. Their P/S ratio implies theyre the TSLA of coffee, but let‚Äôs face it they can only dream of . To add onto this their new CEO looks more bullish on $MCD than she is on $BROS, christin barron if you're reading this: sign up for equinox, get you some $PTON, and maybe ill buy some of your shares.

The only bullish thing is that their CEO is a whale (and not the kind that buys shares) meaning she probably buys her own produce¬†

**TL;DR: if you hate skinny women, love to lose money or both. buy $BROS**

Congrats to the new $1B space stock,"
Finally hit a Billy. Been waiting on this for years. $RDW is the Next Space Stock You Need to Watch ‚Äì Bigger Than $ASTS or $RKLB?

NOTE: tried originally posting this on 10/14, 11/04, and 11/30 and WSB told me I couldn‚Äôt because RDW was ‚Äúunder 500m market cap‚Äù which is wasn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ now trading >$10 a share.¬†

I've been following $RDW (Redwire) for four years now, ever since it IPO‚Äôd via a SPAC. I originally owned the stock back at the IPO, sold it before it fully crashed down to $2, and repurchased 10,000 shares at ~$2.50. I‚Äôve bought and sold on the way up and on dips, currently holding 4,500 shares with a cost basis of $3.83. I also hold two call contracts at a $4 strike price expiring in May 2025.

I‚Äôm a long-term believer in $RDW and believe it has the potential to be one of the biggest winners in the space industry long term, with significant potential for short-term spikes. This post isn‚Äôt about denouncing other space stocks but more about why I believe $RDW can be the winner we all want and need.

NOTE: before diving in, this was originally written on Oct 14, 2024. I‚Äôve since updated this with current numbers as of Nov 30, 2024¬†

-$LUNR: 5,000 shares @ 14.7

But my strongest conviction remains with $RDW and here‚Äôs why.

$RDW Performance & Key Financials

Redwire has shown strong revenue growth but it‚Äôs flying under the radar compared to almost every single one of its peers. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of recent financials:

* 2023:
    * Revenue: $243.8 million (+51.9% YoY)
    * Net Loss: $(27.3) million

Valuation Insights: Why $RDW is Undervalued

Now, let‚Äôs talk about valuation. When looking at revenue versus market cap, $RDW is trading at a much lower multiple than its peers, despite earning more and losing less than almost all of them. This presents a strong case for potential upside if the market starts to recognize its growth.

* $RDW¬†
    * Market Cap: $524.3M (as of Oct 14 at $7.88/share)
        * As of Nov 30, market cap is now $928.9m
    * Revenue multiple: Just 1.69x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, revenue multiple is 3x
* For comparison:
    * $RKLB: ~10x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, 25x¬†
    * $ASTS: 100x revenue
    * $LUNR: ~2-2.5x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, 4.5x
* Why This Matters
    * A lower revenue multiple suggests that $RDW is currently undervalued relative to its peers. It‚Äôs trading at just 1.69x revenue, compared to $RKLB‚Äôs 10x or $SPCE‚Äôs 15x, despite immense market traction and success. If Redwire continues on its growth trajectory, this gap in valuation could close quickly, creating a significant upside opportunity.

Redwire is positioned as a leader in several emerging space technologies that could be game-changers in the next decade. The possibilities here are immense‚Äîespecially with space-based manufacturing, pharma, and autonomous operations becoming key areas of growth in the sector.

The Opportunity: Why Now is the Time

With everything mentioned above, $RDW presents a major opportunity, but here‚Äôs why now could be the time to get in:
* Outstanding shares: 66.54M
* Float: 24.26M (very small compared to peers):
    * $RKLB: 340M
    * $ASTS: 122M
    * $LUNR: 57M
* Short interest: 2.58M shares (10.62% of float)
    * As of Nov 30, short interest is 3M (12% of float)
* Average daily volume: 340k (very low compared to peers):
    * $LUNR: 14.2M
    * $RKLB: 13.1M
    * $ASTS: 16.9M
* Average Daily Volume as of Nov 30: 481k
    * $LUNR: 19.18m
    * $RKLB: 18.52m
    * $ASTS: 12.83m

Low float and low trading volume make $RDW more prone to sharp price movements, especially if the market starts to recognize the value that‚Äôs been overlooked. Add to that the upcoming earnings reports and potential contracts in the pipeline, and you have a recipe for significant price action.

Conclusion:
Given $RDW‚Äôs impressive revenue growth, proven track record, undervaluation compared to peers, and potential for short-term spikes due to low float and trading volume, this is a stock to keep an eye on. While I hold positions in other space stocks, my conviction in $RDW remains the strongest for long-term growth.
* Past
    * Jan 1, 2024: $2.96 ($196.9m market cap - lower than the 2023 revenue)

$5k Hail Mary on $WBD,"I think $WBD is criminally undervalued and has been beaten to a pulp. With the new administration which is friendlier to merger and acquisitions, I think $WBD might fly. They are already planning to split their production/streaming services with the rest of the company. This is a small bet but I think it might pay off.

SPY should rally 10 points or so over the next three days,"I was told I was in the wrong thread when I posted this. So here is a stand alone post.

I think I am going to wait for market open with an upward bias. If SPY breaks the top of the opening 5 minute candle, then retests that level, I am going to get in. Pretty much all the historical charts show that when the debt ceiling gets raised and a shut down is averted, the market reacts in an upward motion to the tune of 10 points or so over the next next week. 

Plus, that selloff that just happened, maps to the 8-5 sell off and the recovery of it so far. So that is even more upward pressure.

I went though all the charts from the all the Government Shutdown Mexican Standoffs we have had since 2018. Holy christ, I am not going to get into politics, but it happens like clockwork every year, shutdown threats start in June, brinksmanship happens, then they pass a last minute bill to stop gap the funding. The market rises after a deal is announced, Senate passes the bill, or President signs it. Not so much on the latter, but it did happen enough. The real juice is in the announcement.

Here is the charts with a brief about each one:

Here we have January of 2018. This was a budget deal that was signed after the government shutdown briefly. Trump signed the bill 2/9/18. You can see the market tore back up by 10 points the next two days.

https://imgur.com/3DoeznQ


This next one see was the border wall funding fight. The budget passed with out the border funding, so Trump shut down the government. He ultimately signed the bill on 1/25 he announce his support for a 3 week extension.

Here is the end of 2019, where yet again, another Mexican stand off. Congress announced a deal on 11/20/19 and signed into law on 11/21/19.

Here is the end of 2020, where we saw yet another stand off, and they announce a deal on 12/20/2020, and signed in on 12/23/2020.

I sat this for the simple fact that almost without fail, when the Government avoids a shutdown on the brink of, the stock market rallies about 10 points the following 3 days.

tl;dr: Stonks only go up. I am buying calls at open on Monday, and happy that I currently have a 605c in the chamber."
TARIFF STOCKPILE CHAOS,"
TL;DR: Trump tariffs = stockpiling = warehouse profits = tendies. 

So Trump‚Äôs tariffs are set to drop on January 20, 2025, and companies are scrambling to stockpile to avoid the import tax. They‚Äôre hoarding inventory to avoid paying the extra costs, and the ones quietly cashing in are the warehouse landlords.

This isn‚Äôt a moonshot or some convoluted 4D chess move. It‚Äôs as simple as this:

Companies are stockpiling.

Warehouses are filling up.

Warehouse landlords are raking it in.

Players who are printing tendies while the rest of us panic-buy toilet paper:

1. Prologis (PLD):
The undisputed king of logistics real estate. They rent warehouses to Amazon, Walmart, and everyone else who sells you stuff you don‚Äôt need. If you want a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù pick, this is it.


2. STAG Industrial (STAG):
These guys are all about single-tenant industrial properties. Perfect for the smaller companies trying to stockpile without getting crushed by the big boys. Higher risk, higher upside.


3. Rexford Industrial (REXR):
Think of these guys as the landlords of Southern California. It‚Äôs one of the busiest logistics markets in the world, and Rexford owns a big piece of it.


4. Americold Realty Trust (COLD):
Niche pick, but they‚Äôre the leaders in temperature-controlled warehouses. All your frozen burritos and vaccines live here. If you‚Äôre feeling fancy, this one‚Äôs for you.
---

My Play

This is what I‚Äôm looking at:

PLD Calls: Expiring January 19, 2025, $135 strike. The steady, ‚Äúboring‚Äù pick.

STAG Calls: Expiring January 19, 2025, $40 strike. Riskier, but the upside is tasty.

REXR Calls: Expiring January 19, 2025, $70 strike. Pure regional gold.


This isn‚Äôt a long-term hold. The goal is to ride the stockpiling wave, cash out before January 20, and avoid getting caught in the tariff aftermath.

What Could Go Wrong

1. Trump delays or cancels the tariffs. Classic move.

2. Companies already maxed out on stockpiling, and demand fizzles.

3. The market tanks, and we all cry together.

But honestly, the catalyst is clear, the players are obvious, and the timeline is set. If this doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs not because the play was dumb‚Äîit‚Äôs because I am.

"
ü¶ç OSHKOSH ($OSK) ‚Äî The No-Resistance Setup ü¶ç,"**Current Price**: $94.98  
**Analyst Target**: $122.86 (+24% Upside)  

üö® **Summary TL;DR** üö®  
Oshkosh ($OSK) is quietly lining up for a **no-resistance breakout**. Between **AI-driven battery tech**, a **$2.98B USPS contract**, and an upcoming showcase at **CES 2025**, the path forward is looking **clearer than ever**. While there was initial fear that the USPS contract might be scrapped, the **Postmaster General has made it clear ‚Äî the plan is moving forward**. With CES set to drop potential headlines, the convergence of bullish catalysts could send this thing higher with **no clear points of resistance**. If the price dips closer to $90, it could mark a pivotal moment for those tracking this play.  

---

## **The Bull Thesis (Why $OSK Has Big Potential) üêÇ**  

---

### ** AI-Powered Battery Tech**  
Oshkosh isn‚Äôt just rolling out standard EVs. They‚Äôve partnered with **Eatron Technologies**, a developer of **AI-driven Battery Management Software (BMS)**. This system makes EV batteries smarter, more efficient, and longer-lasting. Companies like USPS and other fleet operators love this kind of edge because it means lower maintenance, fewer replacements, and higher uptime.  

**Why it matters**:  
- **AI-driven battery optimization = higher fleet performance + lower operating costs.**  
- This is a major selling point for securing more fleet contracts in the future.  
- **Could be featured at CES 2025**, drawing attention from investors, analysts, and potential customers.  

If this tech makes its way into Oshkosh's CES presentation, it has the potential to turn heads. And historically, **companies that reveal fresh tech at CES see share price momentum.**  

üìú **Source**: Oshkosh Investor Relations  

---

### ** The USPS Contract üí∞**  
Here‚Äôs where it gets good. Oshkosh secured a **$2.98B contract** to produce **50,000 next-gen delivery vehicles for USPS**. While some news broke about potential attempts to ""cancel"" the deal, it‚Äôs now clear that **USPS isn‚Äôt backing down**.  

**Key Details**:  
- Congress allocated **$3B to electrify the USPS fleet**, and a portion of that was earmarked specifically for Oshkosh's vehicles.  
- Postmaster General **Louis DeJoy publicly stated** that the electrification plan is moving forward, and it would take an act of Congress to change it.  
- Oshkosh is already building these vehicles in South Carolina, and there's political pressure to maintain jobs in the region.  

This is the kind of steady revenue stream that gives **Wall Street confidence**. It‚Äôs also a reason why analysts have set a **12-month price target of $122.86**. The takeaway? The USPS contract looks more secure than people originally thought.  

**Key Insight**: The market initially reacted to news that the deal could be scrapped, causing the stock to dip. But with the Postmaster General standing firm, the market‚Äôs ""fear trade"" might be over. If this becomes clear to Wall Street, expect the price to **re-rate upward**.  

üìú **Source**: [Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/12/11/us-postal-service-says-it-is-going-electric-despite-trump/)  

---

### ** CES 2025 (The Breakout Catalyst) üöÄ**  
If you‚Äôve been in the game for a while, you know what CES can do to a stock. **CES 2025 is one of the most anticipated tech showcases of the year**, and Oshkosh is set to flex its **AI-driven EV and battery tech** on stage. Historically, CES headlines have been known to send certain stocks flying, especially if they announce something game-changing.  

**Why it matters**:  
- CES is where the big players drop headlines that make institutional investors take notice.  
- If Oshkosh reveals something fresh (like new EV capabilities, fleet partnerships, or advanced AI-battery innovations), expect headlines and volume spikes.  
- Companies that generate buzz at CES often see increased volume and bullish momentum for weeks after the event.  

This event alone could be a **major volume driver**. And since CES 2025 is perfectly timed to align with clarity on the USPS contract, **the combination of these two catalysts could be electric** (pun intended).  

üìú **Source**: Yahoo Finance  

---

### ** Analyst Price Target ($122.86)**  
Wall Street analysts have set a **12-month price target of $122.86**, which represents a **24% upside** from the current price. That‚Äôs **without factoring in potential CES announcements or a clean USPS contract path**. If both of those elements come together, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see analysts increase their targets.  

What this means:  
- Analyst targets are often set using a ""base case"" ‚Äî in this case, it's the USPS contract.  
- **CES 2025 announcements and battery tech innovations are not fully priced in**.  

If this story unfolds as expected, analyst upgrades could act as a secondary catalyst, bringing fresh buying momentum into the stock.  

üìú **Source**: MarketBeat  

---

## **The Bear Risks (Why It Might Not Work) üêª**  

### üî¥ **Supply Chain Pressures**  
Oshkosh needs **chips, metals, and batteries** to make their EVs. If there are bottlenecks in supply (like we‚Äôve seen across the EV space), costs could rise, and production could slow. But since USPS's payments are structured as part of a long-term deal, some of these risks are hedged.  

---

### üî¥ **CES Flop Risk**  
If Oshkosh doesn‚Äôt deliver anything fresh at CES, investors might ""sell the news."" But based on the **AI-driven battery tech and USPS fleet advancements**, it‚Äôs hard to see them walking on stage without something meaningful to share.  

---

## **The No-Resistance Setup (If Everything Clicks) üöÄ**  
Here‚Äôs where it all comes together. The setup for **no resistance** is simple:  

**Postmaster General stands firm** ‚Äî No need for Congress to change the USPS deal.  
**CES 2025 reveals fresh tech** ‚Äî Headlines drop, volume spikes, fresh buyers enter.  
**Wall Street realizes USPS drama was overblown** ‚Äî Price re-rates toward analyst targets.  

If these three elements all hit at once, it‚Äôs hard to see where resistance would kick in. Stocks usually hit resistance where traders start taking profits, but in this case, there's no clear incentive to sell if the path upward remains intact.  

---

## **The Sentiment Check  üó£Ô∏è**  
Here‚Äôs the current market sentiment:  
- **Bullish**: The USPS contract looks more secure than ever, and CES 2025 could be a huge PR moment.  
- **Bearish**: Concerns around supply chain issues and CES execution still exist, but the clarity on the USPS contract has **shifted sentiment toward bullish**.  

---

## **Final Thoughts (The Confluence of Catalysts) üí≠**  

Here‚Äôs the big picture:  
- The **USPS contract is alive**. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy made it clear that USPS is moving forward. The fear of the deal being ""canceled"" is overblown.  
- **CES 2025 could be a headline-fueled breakout catalyst**. If Oshkosh flexes its AI-driven battery tech or announces fresh fleet innovations, expect buying momentum.  
- **AI-driven battery management** gives Oshkosh a long-term competitive edge in future fleet contract bids.  

If the USPS contract stays locked in and CES headlines deliver, there‚Äôs no reason for sellers to step in. This is a **confluence of catalysts** ‚Äî multiple bullish events colliding at the same time. When that happens, resistance doesn‚Äôt matter.  

If you‚Äôre still on the fence, ask yourself this: **What happens if CES headlines hit and the USPS deal stays locked in?**

"Nvidia Will Be the next Intel, Why I'm bearish long term. TSMC is the true winner(assuming China doesn't invade)","Right now, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta are all spending more than Nvidia on R&D and are developing their own AI chips. Tesla, and AMD are also developing AI chips. Right now, tech companies are only buying Nvidia's chips to get started and build market share, because they do not want to fall behind their competition. 

Using Nvidia's chips at current prices is not profitable, even successful AI companies such as OpenAI fail to achieve positive operating margins despite a highly popular product with paid features. Large tech companies are reluctantly buying Nvidia's hardware to avoid falling behind their competition in market share. But relying on Nvidia long term is never the intention, these companies need to be profitable eventually, Nvidia is just there to get them started.

The thing is, Nvidia's 74.56% gross margin is a strength, but its also a vulnerability. It demonstrates that any AI company that can cut out Nvidia can significantly reduce their costs, and that's why everyone is building their own chips. They don't need to be faster than Nvidia to succeed, they just need to be fast enough to provide services at a lower cost, which is quite a low bar. Developing new products takes time, which is why Nvidia's windfall has lasted. But give it 1-3 more years and you'll start to see the impact on Nvidia's sales.

With everyone rushing to develop their own chips, and all of them relying on TSMC, TSMC has the true windfall. They will certainly be able to hike their prices on wafers due to increased demand, which will hurt Nvidia's margins.

Intel was once a dominant and unstoppable player in the semiconductor space, but then they got too comfortable and started spending their cash flow on dividends and stock buybacks instead of reinvesting in R&D. We see how that played out, with AMD catching up and stealing market share, and now Intel is struggling. No moat is impenetrable.

Nvidia is following in Intel's footsteps with their $50 Billion stock buyback plan at 50x earnings. Despite facing competition from the largest tech companies with deep pockets, they are spending their record windfall just to buy back less than 2% of their shares outstanding. This will be their downfall. They are not hedging their reliance on TSMC by seeking to acquire or develop their own fab business, they are not increasing R&D sufficiently to stay ahead of their competition. This will be their downfall.

In 5-10 years, Nvidia will almost certainly have thinner margins and less market share in the AI space as their customers develop their own in-house solutions. At best, Nvidia will be relied upon for niche applications where performance is essential."
$GSAT CEO shits on $ASTS - Sets bear case at $461M/Month/Revenue,"Globalstar CEO Paul Jacobs has been spreading his message that there is no demand for the type of direct-to-device satellite broadband $ASTS offers. And he offers his bear case.

In his CNBC interview on Friday, he cited Idirum and Qualcomm failures in the 90s as evidence that consumers won't pay for coverage away from cell towers - as if consumer expectations have not changed in the last 2 decades.

Yesterday he¬†[cites¬†](https://www.pcmag.com/news/globalstar-ceo-isnt-convinced-people-will-pay-for-cellular-starlink)a study by GSM Association, which suggests only 32% of mobile subscribers would use the service, and they'd only be willing to pay up to 5% more in extra costs.

Quick math using the study he cited and data from Google gives us:

32% of 386M US subscribers currently paying an average $141/Month each = 123M people willing to pay $7.50 per month for satellite D2D. 50/50 revenue share with mobile operators leaves 123M x $3.75 = $461M/Month in revenue up for grabs. That's just the US.

$461M/Month revenue opportunity is his BEAR CASE lol.

Add in Canada, Europe, Africa, Japan, and the path to $1B/Month revenue for ASTS is easy to see.

ASTS current Mktcap: 7B

Prediction: Mktcap 150B by 2027

GOOG vs TSLA: Money Spinner vs Monkeys,"Listen up, you smooth-brained, tendie-chasing, wife‚Äôs-boyfriend simping fucks. If you‚Äôre ignoring GOOG and still long TSLA, you deserve the ~~portfolio~~ big red dildo that you have.üöÄ

**GOOG - like a wife on a Wednesday, she‚Äôs not going down.**

Alphabet isn‚Äôt just Google anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs the tech overlord running your life, your ads, and the YouTube rabbit holes you waste your life in.

1. While you drool over ChatGPT, Google‚Äôs Gemini is out here printing real money while your wife drives away with ‚ÄúTim from finance‚Äù.

2. YouTube = Tendies from all ages: It‚Äôs monetizing both the Boomers and Gen Z eyeballs milking them for every cent.

3. Cloud Revenue üöÄ : Google Cloud is up **30%** YoY. They‚Äôre catching up to AWS and Azure like a freight train and THERE IS NO SAFE WORD!

4. Weymo, Tokyo, up-go, y‚Äôknow?

5. It‚Äôs Not Even Overpriced (Yet): PE ~26. If you‚Äôre still crying that ‚ÄúBig Tech is expensive,‚Äù literally just shut the fuck up.

GOOG is a low-risk, high-reward tendie train for monk√©s who want to stop seeing ~~RED~~ their wife getting trained on the weekends.

**TSLA - The big-Brain Hedge You are still too Dumb to Consider**

Tesla is the most overvalued clown car on the market. It looks like shit, it‚Äôs priced like shit and the groupies make it sound like Musk just invented teleportation, cured baldness, and colonized Mars simultaneously. **Spoiler Alert! >!He didn‚Äôt!<.**

1. When the Market loses hype momentum, TSLA Gets Nuked ‚ò†Ô∏è . Overvalued growth names like Tesla get slapped like a hookers cheeks behind Wendy‚Äôs, especially if JPow pulls the wrong face.

2. Buying OTM put spreads is a small cost to hedge your brainless GOOG upside. If TSLA drops 20%, you‚Äôre eating so many tendies you‚Äôll need a stairmaster to get to bed.

**TLDR** **GOOG Calls** Buy it, hold it, shut up. It‚Äôs free money. **TSLA Put Spreads** Buy a cheap put spread. If the market slips, TSLA dumps, and you get paid.

If the market moons, GOOG wins. If the market dies, TSLA pays for your next YOLO. Either way, you‚Äôre not left high and dry like the rest of the regards here.

Don‚Äôt fumble this you fucking idiot.

Allow me to explain why this UNH dip is the dumbest shit ever and calls is the way.,"**Position TLDR:** Not Financial advice. Positions are 5/5 Vertical Jan 3 545/550 P (Currently ITM) and 10 calls Jan 17th 600/610 C (Yes, I'm revenge trading.) I also hold the underlying shares. Image provided, unlike the people on this Reddit, and to prove the trading is live. (Also took forever to get this post made auto mod/Reddit has really gotten harsh on what they allow)

**Real TLDR:** UNH dropped to $480 due to CEO Brian Thompson's meme death. Fundamentals are solid, the dip is an overreaction, and $550+ is realistic.

https://preview.redd.it/q513l7ag7h7e1.png?width=1313&format=png&auto=webp&s=85e572f517a931c603ef93c397e519f55817339b

* **Strong Financials:** UNH has $25B in annual cash flow, enabling consistent reinvestment, share buybacks, and dividends. They have more capital than they know what to do with.
* **EPS Guidance:** Earnings per share guidance remains solid. With an aging and increasingly unhealthy population, demand for healthcare will rise in the short, medium, and long term. Medicare Advantage reimbursement policies remain steady, and most political chatter on the topic lacks actionable impact.
* **Leadership Team:** Andrew Hayek (CEO of OptumHealth) and Dirk McMahon (President of UNH) are seasoned industry leaders. They‚Äôve streamlined processes to maximize profitability (not a moral statement, just a financial one).
* **Market Position:** UNH remains the largest insurance provider in the U.S., with Optum leading in analytics and service. Their position is set to grow further with potential deregulation during the next political cycle.
* **Valuation:** The current price-to-earnings ratio is 18x forward earnings, below the historical average of 22x. Institutional investors have held steady despite recent events, short interest is at its lowest since the ‚Äúincident,‚Äù and dividends remain in safe territory.
* **Fair Market Value:** Discounted cash flow models and reports show a fair market value of $715. Using a 22x forward EPS (historical average), $550 in the short term is reasonable, with $570+ achievable if EPS beats to $26 (earnings on 01/10/2025).

**Final TLDR:** Stock is only down because some dumbass forgot to hire security and got blasted by some silver-spooned mafia-linked Italian that happens to be moderately attractive.

**Possible Risk:** Trump actually fucks with the healthcare industry (Unlikely), Market eats shit in 2025 (Somewhat likely), UNH somehow managers to not hire a new CEO (Unlikely just move Andrew Hayek)

Fact-check me, Roast me, call me names, say I'm coping, etc. I don't care. The stock is undervalued by 200-300$ and has no reason to be this low absolute value play and if I had more cash to burn i'd be buying UNH like white on rice.."
The Big Short 2 - The Even Blacker Swan,"This community was close to perfect back in its heyday.  It was a den of degenerate high risk gamblers who adequately self-moderated their community with extreme toxicity.  If someone asked an innocent question, responses of hope you lose everything, that you will fuck their wife, or they are going to be sucking dick behind Wendy's for three fiddy a pop should always be appropriate behavior here.  Quite simply, If people cannot stomach this kind of toxicity, how would they be able to stomach the real world consequences of losing a couple million dollars in an hour, losing their house, or actually losing their spouse because of degenerate behavior.  Being inclusive or nice to people in this community actually makes the world a shittier place as it normalizes extremely high risk behavior that should not be for everyone.  I accordingly want to tell each of you to go fuck yourselves and I hope you can provide me with the level of toxicity that matches or exceeds this in return - I want your worst.       

I like Black Swan's and this post represents DD for such an investment.  Ultimately I am posting this here because I really want someone to prove my investment thesis wrong - PLEASE PROVE ME WRONG.  The math is so extremely simple that I am going to present my thesis mostly with meme's because I believe that the financial apocalypse should be something light hearted and filled with humor.  This is DD accordingly is for the collapse of the global financial system and if I am correct that will make 2 for 2 on calling black swans on wsb (so much better then Burry who has predicted 450 of the last 2 crashes).  Technically everything collapsed back in September 2019 and has been held together with tape and bits of string, but nobody really wants to identify the problem and I have no problem telling the truth so here we go.   

1)  Interest.  The Federal Reserve pays currently pays banks an annual interest rate of 4.65% on Bank Reserves.

https://preview.redd.it/6a48nsdepg7e1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=50e42cb98758b46e68c1b39b11320cb9fc468f45

2) Principal.  Banks currently have $3,211,700,000,000 ($3.2 Trillion) in Bank Reserves help with the Federal Reserve.  Bank Reserves only exists in such high amounts as a balancing entry for the Federal Reserve's Quantitative Easing (QE) programs - when people joke about the Federal Reserve printing money they are referencing the process of creating Bank Reserves out of thin air.  QE was used to support the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis, COVID, or simply when wall street was lazy and didn't want to work (the ""Taper Tantrum""); the Federal Reserve creates ""Bank Reserves"" to purchase ""toxic assets"" from Bank's to stimulate the economy.

3) The Federal Reserve is currently paying $149 Billion in interest on Bank Reserves (Interest rate in item 1 multiplied by the total deposits in item 2).  The Bank's dragged their feet and didn't absorb the toxic assets previously sold to the Federal Reserve back onto their balance sheets quick enough (these are truly garbage assets so why would you want to buy them back?).   When a rate hiking cycle was required to combat inflationary pressures, Central Banks around the world labelled inflation as ""transitory"" as hiking rates illuminates the massive problem with QE if it wasn't unwound.  It's a game of chicken right now, the Bank's are being rewarded by being paid interest on historical bailouts (they are keeping their mouths shut), the Central Banks (including the Fed) are insolvent and are hoping they can find a way out still (they are silent), and Governments are starting to collapse around the world.

4) The financial system is being propped up with an hidden bailout.  The Bank's don't have enough liquidity to pull the toxic assets back onto their balance sheets or to repay the interest that rightfully belongs to taxpayers.  As the Bank's, Central Banks, and the Government's are all hiding this problem from the world, how can taxpayers support another bailout to an industry that refused to fix its own problems.  As per FDIC cumulative Trailing-Twelve-Month Net Income for the 4,517 commercial banks and savings institutions is $236.9 Billion and the majority of these earnings are attributed to interest paid by the fed.  This bailout (Fed Interest) isn't even fairly paid out (concentrated to the largest banks/prime brokerages) and we are about to enter a race to the bottom.  ""Are you there Jamie Dimon? It's Me, God""

"
Tesla Bull and Bear case: the great AI and liability gamble,"Tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently, nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump‚Äôs victory and Elon Musk‚Äôs instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon‚Äôs influence to relax regulations, clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout‚Äîa potential game-changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole.

Tesla is trading like an AI startup, and for good reason: its ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving‚Äù (FSD) system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look.  


# The Bull Case: Tesla‚Äôs data volume

Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla‚Äôs fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a ‚Äúshadow trainer‚Äù for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.

Behind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases‚Äîrare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla‚Äôs massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla‚Äôs vision-only approach‚Äîusing cameras without lidar‚Äîmakes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.





# The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality

More data is not always better, and it‚Äôs possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.¬† The result is a more diverse dataset that‚Äôs constantly evolving.

Waymo is owned by Alphabet (Google‚Äôs parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.¬† Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.¬† Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.¬† But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.¬† This means that its data is much richer in quality.¬† The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla‚Äôs suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.

The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn‚Äôt just an incremental step‚Äîit‚Äôs an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.

Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments‚Äîplaces like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla‚Äôs FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.

As the saying goes, ‚ÄúIf you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.‚Äù If Waymo‚Äôs AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it‚Äôs far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla‚Äôs suburban data might create a ‚Äúsame-shit-different-day‚Äù scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.

# Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword

If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla‚Äôs liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.¬† Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.

Tesla‚Äôs data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics‚Äîwhich is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it's a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.

# The scalability myth

Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo‚Äôs reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn‚Äôt hold weight for two reasons.¬† First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla‚Äôs camera-only system.¬† Ironically, Elon‚Äôs first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be that way.¬† Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.¬† When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?¬† Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.



# Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google

Waymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It‚Äôs AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo‚Äôs superior compute power (via Google‚Äôs custom TPUs) means it‚Äôs clearly dominant in this regard.

Tesla bulls often cite Elon‚Äôs dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla‚Äôs superior approach. But they overlook Google‚Äôs hegemony in AI.¬† They were in the game before anyone.¬† They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla‚Äôs Dojo may be promising, but it‚Äôs still a newbie.  
  


# tl;dr

Tesla‚Äôs $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.¬† If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality, liability risks, and Waymo‚Äôs technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind.  In which case, it's vastly overvalued.

$AMD Bottoms Within the Next $10,"Intro:  
Many of you are probably pretty tired of $AMD. The last 8 or so months of downtrend is pretty deterring, especially while $NVDA continues to tear upwards. You're also probably tired of seeing hopium posts in the midst of tons of bear posts. I think most agree that fundamentally $AMD is a great company that should not be negative YTD. For those of you that have been waiting a long time to see it catch a bid off of the AI hype and necessity for chips, I think the wait is coming to an end. It's easy to point at the institutions and hedge funds and blame them for nuking the price, but hopefully with this thesis I can show that $AMD structurally is ready to reverse. To the untrained eye, the chart displayed should be easy to read, you can see the similarities between the two corrections quite easily. If any of you see any holes in this thesis please let me know. ""but institutional buying/selling,  unusual options, market dominance,"" Yea IDGAF about all that, just let me know if there are holes in the technical analysis.  If you don't want to read, I'll sum it up briefly:  AMD will bottom at $114-$121, followed by an HTF extension to $330.

Length of Corrections, Fibonacci Levels, Timing of Earnings & Structure:  
The first correction pictured lasted \~315 days, bottoming \~21 days from prior to earnings. The current correction is pacing to also finish within the golden pocket ($114-$122, where institutions have most interest in buying), matching the length of the previous correction and also \~21 days off of the next earnings. Earnings are marked in blue vertical lines on the chart. As you can see with our current correction, we are likely in the final wave of our ABCDE correction. There is a small chance we could skip the golden pocket and shoot for the 0.236 @ $96, but this is quite unlikely. The run up that followed the previous correction saw price top at $227, nearly touching our 1.618 extension at $232. If we see the same process unfold: A bounce and run up from the pocket, we could expect our 1.618 to be @ $333 per share, pictured in the top right.

MACD & RSI:  
Once again, If you just study the structure of the MACD underneath the two corrections, it is easy to see how close they are in form. I'm not going to attempt to explain each cross and describe what I am seeing in words, the charts speak for themselves for MACD. RSI during the previous correction saw a low highlighted in green at the bottom at 32. The previous two run ups both peaked at 82, and I would like to think it is highly likely RSI will bottom at 32 again, currently sitting at 39. This one it is also easy to see the similarities in structure on the chart. MACD and RSI showing the same structure as the last correction before a 300% run with a bottom going into earnings is possibly the most bullish copy and paste set up I have seen in a long time.

Conclusion:  
I don't wish to spread more lackluster hopium for this stock. I am trying to make the point that structurally, if it were to bottom and reverse, within the next month would be the most logical place for this to occur. Hopefully, those that have been burned holding this stock understand that it simply just needed time to cool off after that 300% run. Once markets find the price has been pushed low enough it should begin another, it's literally illustrated in the charts. I could be wrong. There could be more downside after the golden pocket, but this is a play I am willing to lose money on because it meets every checkmark presented from an analysis view. If it folds I cannot be upset because I stuck with the rules and didn't put money somewhere else that didn't look as structurally sound.

MongoDB $MDB - all in on a bargain ,"It‚Äôs been mentioned here before but not enough. The COO leaving is NOT a big deal. A new one comes in and it‚Äôs back on its way up! The latest earnings report was great. 
It recently reported strong Q3 2024 earnings, exceeding expectations with a 30% year-over-year revenue increase. Its full-year sales outlook was raised, now forecasting revenues up to $1.977 billion. Analysts (I know who cares but still) remain optimistic, with an average 12-month price target of $379.81, representing a 42% potential upside from its current price of about $267. Key drivers include its adoption in AI-powered solutions and Atlas database platform growth.

NFE Technicals storm for 12/20,"Edit: Added PT, timeline, and charts thanks to feedback from u/OryxDaMadGod

First post here. I've been following NFE for about 4 months when I wondered why a growth stock was trading so low (it's the debt - always the debt). I think there's something up next week and I wanted to share my analysis to see what others think. Note: I think it's a great long term play (I'm a value investor) even if this doesn't play out.

**Thesis**: The volume needed to drive a breakout from a cup and handle pattern will be triggered by options activity next week.

**PT**: $19-20 long term but some expectation that it will massively overshoot this short term (see discussion below)

My strikes sit from $12-15 over the next 5 weeks. I didn't do lots of math to calculate. The volume on options is low so I just looked for strikes that seemed like good deals (e.g. $15 1/17 strikes would go from 35c to 65c on only a 30c underlying price movement so when they pulled back, I bought).

**Timeline**: I think this will take place over the next week but because some of the TA is on the 5 year chart, my strikes go from now into the middle of January.

**The technicals** (note, all options data is for 12/20 which is a major expiration date for this stock):

1. We're 1 week into the handle of a cup and handle pattern

Volume has been decreasing in the handle. (sorry chart not too fancy)

[volume for the last week of NFE](https://preview.redd.it/mc3w02zem17e1.png?width=1543&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1f8ec5e0fe16eca62c2e84d1915ffbb22113f7f)

[cup and handle pattern for NFE](https://preview.redd.it/pn0znincn17e1.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=98d2f52dc88b9326ad2f140b51d2d1098856f9a5)

2. There are 10k ITM Calls, 58k OTM Puts (average daily volume \~5m so the 1 million shares the ITM calls represent is significant)

Sidebar: I notice that when a large amount of Puts are ITM it causes the stock to slide on expiration day and vice versa when a large number of Calls are ITM. This effect centers around the highest OI amounts (maybe there's a name for it, idk - it's not the same as max pain)

3. The largest block of OTM Puts sit below the resistance line ($12) with a fair number of Calls around that strike sitting ITM

4. The largest OI Call is at $19 - which just happens to line up with the cup and handle formula of ""rim - bottom + resistance"": Approximately 13.5-7.8 + 13.5 = 19.2

That call was opened on 10/25 and coincides with the bottom of the cup AND news that FLNG1 had completed its 3rd run (1st run doesn't matter - 3rd run shows ""It works"").

This could have been a hedge for a short seller or someone who thought ""hey, if it retakes the former bottom resistance, then I want to own the shares"". I have no idea. I just find it interesting. It could serve as resistance or support depending on what the buyer is thinking.

5. SI is 36.2m shares or almost 32% of the float and daily volume is \~5m

6. The PUT interest for strikes from 10.5-11.5 went up for 12/20 at the same time as the price did and proportionally to the volume increase. This indicates that we have a new buyer hedging in case the price doesn't move the direction they want in the short term. But it also means we have a secondary bullish whale who is willing to support this move by writing the PUTs.

Not advice - but anyone can make this trade. As you buy shares, buy PUTs so if the price does fall, you don't lose as much.

[PUT interest increase](https://preview.redd.it/7mp4ca3dk17e1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2b3fd2d23ee43eb20b2aaf5392a64ac6303e8ed)

7. The 5 year chart shows head and shoulders (which is bearish) but I think the cup and handle reverses that trend. It also says something fascinating about support.

**The low of 5 years ago was the low of last month.**

**The current price point is almost the same as the breakout price point from 5 years ago.**

**My PT aligns with previous supports over the last 5 years.**

[previous support level matches PT](https://preview.redd.it/24plvpppo17e1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=108af57109ab6fed5f01382860ae57dbe2a7bf26)

**The non-technicals:**

1. NFE tanked because of a huge Q2 miss (project delays) and debt concerns. Q3 is back on track.

Conspiracy theory time... That ""miss"" allowed the CEO to invest $50mil at almost the bottom of the cup. There's a lot of correlation/causation arguments to make here, but all I'm saying is, this is how the rich get richer.

*Note of caution: I think there is a lawsuit related to this.*

2. There's been a confluence of good news in the last week. *Note: These could be reasons for the right side of the cup forming and without further catalyst, the handle might collapse.*

\- They've completed all the debt refinancing that they said they would (pushed it to 2029).

\- They announced a new 10 year charter with EGAS

\- Bloomberg wrote that they're in talks to sell a few assets that could be worth 1-2 billion

\- There is supposed to be a 500mil payment from FEMA related to a broken contract. I'm not optimistic on it but if it does happen, it's a catalyst

3. NFE makes money - a lot of it. At the base of the cup, the P/S was \~1. I know this isn't a valid metric for their industry but I find it interesting. They have been burning a lot on CapEx.

*Tangent: The last time I invested in a company that the markets hated because of CapEx was Facebook at $90. I feel like markets overreact to CapEx.*

4. The industry has a PE ratio average of 30. While it's hard to predict NFE's future earnings, even at a conservative $1/share for 2025, you'd be looking at $30. I think that average PE seems high (again, value investor here) but I could justify a 20 ratio given the growth nature which puts us right back at the \~19 target.

The initial bump is between 3-5% usually from the announcement depending on the stock. Usually followed by 2-4% gains in the following days during the rebalancing. MSTR is in a unique position where it can go up 10-20% with any push during this bull rally.

¬•\~Future - Event

This will create a forced buying event when they are included in the Nasdaq100 as ETFs like that track the Nasdaq100 would need to rebalance their holdings to comply with their fund rules. this occurs in the weeks leading to the official re-balance date.

$YY - The Chinese Social Media App That‚Äôs Already Banned,"TLDR: The Bigo Live app has been taken down by Apple and Google for **allowing sales of child porn.** The Bigo Live app is about 80% of $YY‚Äôs revenue - and this hasn‚Äôt been reported widely - the stock has barely moved

**Overview**

On December 5th, Bigo Live was removed from both the iOS and Android app stores [following reports in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/us/child-abuse-apple-google-apps.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE4.IjV3.IUb4nn1olfoc&smid=url-share.) of the app allowing users to pay to watch livestreams of child sexual abuse. The app is still gone (search in your app store)

Joyy ($YY) is a Chinese social media company that gets most of its revenue from the Bigo Live app.

This doesn't seem to be covered anywhere related to $YY - for example [on Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/yy). Presumably because this is a small-cap Chinese stock no one cares about. The stock is down about 3.5% since the news was reported.

**$YY Revenue Breakdown**

Looking at their [Q3 Earnings](https://ir.joyy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/joyy-reports-third-quarter-2024-unaudited-financial-results) \- **BIGO apps are about 90% of their profit and revenue.**

https://preview.redd.it/brtjouauun6e1.png?width=2470&format=png&auto=webp&s=acbab4e2f3d59058a5122617570cd816c282991e

Two other apps, IMO and Likee are under BIGO here - but are about 10% of the total revenue

https://preview.redd.it/nqwbr0ftun6e1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5d7825599fc604c48519989febd05ba84e07877

So Bigo Live alone should be around 80% of $YY‚Äôs revenue and profit.

It‚Äôs worth noting that average revenue per paying user over the quarter was **$231** \- their content clearly monetized well.

They do have a website - [bigo.tv](http://bigo.tv) \- but I suspect it‚Äôs a small portion of their revenue. They don‚Äôt break out the data in their last [annual report](https://ir.joyy.com/static-files/de629d35-c15e-4046-82d7-856fddbd1d41) but they do say

>We primarily rely on thirdparty application distribution channels, such as the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store, to allow users to download and access our applications and games.

Bigbear.ai will reach 10$,"BigBear.AI is a company specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning, focusing on providing data-driven decision support for businesses, governments, and other organizations. BigBear.AI uses advanced analytics and predictive modeling to help its clients solve complex problems related to operations, supply chain management, cybersecurity, and various other fields. This company is very similar to Palantir.

1. Financial Performance

As of its most recent filings, BigBear.AI‚Äôs financials reveal some of the typical challenges faced by AI startups. While the company has shown promising revenue growth, it also faces substantial losses typical of growth-oriented tech firms. Here are some points to consider:

¬∑       Revenue Growth: BigBear.AI has been reporting increasing revenues year-over-year, though it's still in a relatively early stage of growth. The demand for AI-driven solutions in its key markets, particularly in defense and logistics, is a positive sign.

¬∑       Profitability: The company has not yet achieved profitability, and like many tech firms, it is investing heavily in research and development (R&D) to grow its business. High operating expenses, particularly related to R&D and sales, contribute to ongoing losses.

3. Growth Potential

BigBear.AI operates in a rapidly growing market for AI and data analytics, particularly in industries like defense, healthcare, and logistics. AI‚Äôs potential for optimizing operations and decision-making is vast, and BigBear.AI is well-positioned to tap into this growth in several ways:

¬∑       Government Contracts: As a provider of AI-based solutions, BigBear.AI is in a favorable position to secure long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other defense agencies. This is a key growth avenue, especially given the U.S. government's ongoing investments in defense technology and AI.

¬∑       Private Sector Demand: Outside of government contracts, industries like healthcare, energy, and logistics are investing heavily in AI solutions to improve efficiency and reduce costs. BigBear.AI‚Äôs solutions could appeal to these sectors as they continue to digitize operations and use data analytics for decision-making.

4. Competitive Position

The AI and analytics space is highly competitive, with numerous well-established players such as Palantir Technologies, IBM, and newer startups like C3.ai. BigBear.AI's competitive advantage lies in its ability to provide highly specialized solutions tailored to industries like defense and logistics. Some of its strengths include:

¬∑       Niche Focus: BigBear.AI has developed deep expertise in industries where AI can have a transformative impact, such as defense and national security. This focus could help it carve out a strong market position and defend against competition from larger, more diversified companies.

¬∑       Technological Differentiation: BigBear.AI leverages cutting-edge AI and machine learning techniques, including predictive analytics, which could give it an edge in providing high-value, data-driven insights.

"""Restoration Hardware: Chart Insights, Citadel's Confidence, and Cramer's Bullish Take""
","https://preview.redd.it/q39324n4g56e1.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=0260bb0ba6641453c5653d6eaea8777b102d1426

The much-anticipated earnings report for Restoration Hardware (RH) is here! And just to clear up some confusion‚ÄîRH is **not** the ticker for Robinhood, which goes by **HOOD**. These are two completely different companies operating in entirely separate industries. So let‚Äôs not mix them up! Now, let‚Äôs dive into the exciting part‚Äîanalyzing the chart. Think of it as reading a map, with the goal of figuring out where the stock price might be headed next. Charts are like a story‚Äîthey tell us where the price has been, where it hesitated, and where it‚Äôs eager to go next.

Here‚Äôs what the chart says about RH:

* **September 2023 Selloff**: On Friday, September 8, 2023, RH reported earnings, and it was an ugly day for the stock. The market reacted violently, pushing the price down to a low of **$220**. This became a critical support level, where the stock essentially said, ‚ÄúOkay, this is as low as I‚Äôm going.‚Äù
* **Consolidation Zone**: After that dramatic drop, the stock spent months trading between **$260 and $300**. This period is what we call the ‚Äúfair price‚Äù range‚Äîtraders found balance here, agreeing on the stock‚Äôs value at that time.
* **March 2024 Surprise Rally**: Fast forward to March 27, 2024, RH reported worse-than-expected earnings‚Äîrevenues came in at **$738.26M**, well below the **$777.5M** estimate. Oddly enough, the stock didn‚Äôt crash. Instead, it rallied, climbing all the way back to **$355**, showing the market's resilience and optimism about RH.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about more recent events:

* **September Earnings Gap Up**: This time, RH reported earnings that seemed to excite the market. The stock gapped up and started consolidating in a higher price range. But there‚Äôs a catch‚Äîit recently tested the **$400 resistance level** twice and got rejected both times. This formed a classic **double top**, which typically signals a lack of buying interest at higher levels. Essentially, buyers said, ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù

So, what could happen next?

* The **50-day SMA** at **$342** looks like the first line of defense. If the price drops, it‚Äôll likely touch this level to find support.
* But here‚Äôs where it gets interesting‚Äîthere‚Äôs also an unfilled gap at **$290**. Gaps on charts act like unfinished business, and prices often revisit them to ‚Äúfill‚Äù the gap. If selling pressure increases, we could see the stock heading back to that level.

Let‚Äôs not forget about Citadel's role in this story. On **September 26, 2024**, Citadel filed a **Schedule 13G**, revealing they collectively own about **3.9%** of RH‚Äôs shares. That‚Äôs a pretty significant chunk! Kenneth Griffin, Citadel‚Äôs founder, has shared voting and dispositive power over these holdings. This kind of institutional backing can be a positive signal‚Äîit shows confidence in RH‚Äôs potential. However, if Citadel ever decides to sell a substantial portion of their shares, it could create downward pressure on the stock price.

And what‚Äôs Jim Cramer‚Äôs take? He‚Äôs bullish on RH! Cramer believes the company‚Äôs performance is closely tied to the housing market, which has been showing strength. He even included RH in his top stock picks, emphasizing that it‚Äôs outperforming Wall Street‚Äôs expectations. His advice? **‚ÄúBuy early to get ahead of the turn.‚Äù** Basically, he thinks RH is a smart long-term play, especially if the housing sector continues to grow.

In summary, RH‚Äôs chart is telling an exciting story of recovery, resistance, and potential. While the **$400 resistance** remains a tough hurdle, strong support levels at **$342** and **$290** could offer opportunities for buyers. Add to that the confidence from Citadel and optimism from Jim Cramer, and you‚Äôve got a stock that‚Äôs definitely worth keeping an eye on!"
Unity Technologies ,"https://preview.redd.it/hbzkp23fz26e1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=698c4992c16ee91fc7afc47c3a28e81add772ebc

Unity Software Inc. (doing business as¬†**Unity Technologies**) is a technology company that specializes in developing and operating a platform for creating real-time 3D content and experiences. Unity is primarily known for its game engine and development tools, which allow creators to build, run, and monetize interactive 2D and 3D content across various platforms.

Their engine and development tools is used in wide range of industries including Video game development , architecture and design , automotive , film and animation , and virtual and augmented reality.

They are a duopoly in the game engine market with Epic Games (Unreal Engine). Unity holds approximately 40-50% of the game engine market share, while Unreal Engine accounts for 10-20%. As of 2023, over 70% of the top mobile games globally were developed using Unity's platform. In 2024, mobile gaming is expected to generate approximately $92.6 billion in revenue compared to $51.9 billion for console gaming and $40 billion for PC gaming. As of 2024, a significant portion of VR apps in the Apple Store are likely created using Unity, with estimates suggesting that¬†over 60%¬†of AR/VR content across platforms is made with Unity.

Unity's stock have been doing poorly ever since the great 2022 bear market , the John Riccitiello fee incident (2022) , and the dreadful IronSource purchase (2022) under his tenure. They have since fired him in 2023 and appointed Matthew Bromberg as Unity's new Chief Executive Officer, President, and a member of the Unity Board of Directors, effective May 15, 2024. Bromberg has since replaced all the C-suites with competent people. They did a reset on their portfolio to put their focus on their core business which they refer to as their ""Strategic Portfolio"": the Engine, Cloud and Monetization.

The Strategic Portfolio consists of two main segments:

* Create Solutions: This segment encompasses Unity's game development platform and tools. In Q3 2024, Create Solutions revenue grew 5% year-over-year, driven by subscription growth. The Create segment includes:

1. Unity game engine and development tools
2. Unity 6, the latest version of the engine with over 500,000 downloads
3. Expansion into non-gaming industries (Industry segment), which grew **59% year-over-year and represents 18% of Create revenue**

* Grow Solutions: This segment includes advertising and monetization tools. In Q3 2024, Grow Solutions revenue declined by 5%. It focuses on:

1. Advertising technology
2. Monetization services for game developers
3. Development of a new advertising model set to launch in 2025

Let's discuss the mobile gaming monetization and advertising space and their competitor AppLovin (the stock that is up 768% YTD) . AppLovin wanted to buy Unity for $20B back in 2022 to form a monopoly but got rejected. Unity has since failed to keep up with AppLovin who is now the third largest mobile gaming in-app advertising network after Google and Meta. Unity-ironSource platform couldn't compete with AppLovin's platform but things are about to change because the new CEO hired Jim Payne to join the company as Chief Product Officer for Advertising effective August 12, 2024. Payne co-founded MoPub, the world‚Äôs largest mobile in-app ad server and exchange, and MAX Advertising Systems, a mobile header bidding platform (both acquired by AppLovin and are essential pieces to their success). In their latest earning's call Bromberg said they have a new machine learning model in their new neural network that is being tested on their live data that will be ready to launch when it's ready (probably sometime next year). APP's current mcap is $111B while Unity is at $10.78B , if their new ML model is competitive , the stock can easily **10x from here just from the Grow Solutions business**. This is why some people are looking to short AppLovin and long Unity.

On the Create Solution side Unity recently announced on Oct 30, 2024 they hired Ex-King CTO and Havok Co-Founder Steve Collins as CTO which will add key technical leadership to accelerate product innovation, quality, and stability.  In 2023, Havok products were used in twelve of the top twenty best selling video games in the United States. Their 3D engine is utilized not only for game development but also by a diverse range of clients in non-gaming industries for real-time product visualization, virtual prototyping, AR customer experiences, digital twins and other 3D applications. This segment grew 59% year-over-year and is expected to become an increasingly significant contributor to their Create revenue in the future.

[Palantir's Mixed Reality offerings are built with Unity's 3D engine. They are just one of several partners from industries outside of gaming. https:\/\/www.palantir.com\/offerings\/mixed-reality\/](https://preview.redd.it/zw7w2aj2z26e1.png?width=2379&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4f900c7489db3c6841321cb494c66a8c0035add)

Unity's engine and development tools is also utilized by the The Department of Defense (DoD). They primarily use the Unity engine to create realistic, immersive virtual training simulations for military personnel, allowing them to practice complex scenarios in a safe and controlled environment across various domains like combat tactics, vehicle operation, war simulations and situational awareness, all within a 3D digital world.

Unity Technologies Corporation (UnityTec) has been awarded two significant contracts related to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD):

* [JETS 2.0 Contract](https://govtribe.com/opportunity/federal-contract-opportunity/dla-j6-enterprise-technology-services-jets-2-dot-0-sp470923r0001-45) : UnityTec secured a position on the Defense Logistics Agency's J6 Enterprise Technologies Services 2.0 (JETS 2.0) multiple-award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. This contract has a maximum value of $12 billion and will provide a broad range of IT-related services to the entire DoD for up to 12 years.
* CACI Contract: Unity signed a ""multi-million dollar"" contract with enterprise technology firm CACI to become the ""preferred real-time 3D platform"" for U.S. government defense projects.

Now back in 2015 [Mark Zuckerberg sent a four page internal email](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-unity.pdf) to key executives to get in early on the AR and VR future. In that email , Mark Zuckerberg wanted to purchase Unity because he believes AR/VR is the major computing platform after mobile and they will gain control over a key development platform for AR/VR content. He believes the acquisition of Unity would also mitigate the risk of a competitors like Google and Apple from acquiring them and limiting Meta (Facebook then) access to the platform. One of the possible reasons the acquisition fell through is antitrust concerns because Meta would be a monopoly in VR/AR if they own Unity.

I believe the future is XR (extended reality) and that XR will be next major and final computing platform after mobile. I believe Meta could potentially become the largest company in the world within the next 10-20 years if Apple/Google/Microsoft don't catch up in XR especially in AR which Meta is leading. Regardless of who wins, Unity will be one of the main foundations behind the XR gold rush. In conclusion, I‚Äôm highly optimistic about Unity, as they hold a vital role in the XR ecosystem. This is a long-term investment for generational wealth.

This post is made for posterity.

ARGT will continue to grow uncontrollably for the foreseeable future. ,"While this isn't a stock that is going to make you a millionaire overnight it is definitely a stock that will make you a millionaire in a year if you play your cards right. 

ARGT is an etf tracking Argentinian linked companies. 

If you had been paying attention to the news recently you would know that Argentinas economy is completely in the shitter. It's been completely ruined by the government and suffering from true hyperinflation for years. However last year a man name Milei took control of the government and began slashing government spending like crazy to reduce inflation. 

Inflation is way down (with still quite a ways to go) and the economy is beginning to show signs of life, but the place is still an economic shitshow that will take some years to fix. However in those years of recovery you have the opportunity to get exposure to a rapidly recovering economy at the ground level. Based on the stock price, the markets have clearly seen the potential for the Argentinian economy and milei is cozying up to trump and Elon specifically which will be helpful in obtaining foreign investments from the US. 

If you look at the ARGT ticker you will see it on an insane but consistent run since milei came into power. This is not a single ticker that will 10x overnight or that will short squeeze, but it will very likely continue to rise 50-100% per year for several years going forward (barring global economic catastrophe). The economy is coming off historic lows and international financial optimism is rising with every new inflation and gdp metric they publish. 

I am jacked to the tits with 95$ July 2025 calls, and I encourage you to do the same as well. If the rate of growth of this etf maintains its current pace the stock will be around 120-130 by July 2025 and those calls will return 8-10x (currently those options are selling for approximately 4$).

DD for the Upcoming Mining market for Crypto over the next four years,"Okay guys so I've never made a DD post. This is prep for the next four years. What is DD on? Well, The crypto market. And before anyone says bItcOiN oNLy, i'm talking about Bitcoin, but mainly the companies around bitcoin. What do I mean?

**There are companies that literally just mine bitcoin as a ""job""**

So I have three as of rn since I don't make a lot of money and have to buy cheap. Riot Industries $RIOT, Bitfarms $BITF, and Hive $HIVE. Literally anything crypto mining related right, but I think RIOT will get the most benefit out of all because it's headquartered in the Great US of A. So as of making this post, RIOT is at 12$. I actually used to own 100 shares but I discovered options and went from 3k to 0 and haven't traded in a while. However, I'm an orthodox marxist and me no like my country anymore, so Imma head out on jah just gotta get some money first.

Okay, so Riot has three plantations where they mine Bitcoin. As everyone knows, the Trump pick made crypto go on a bull run and Bitcoin reached 100k before lowering back down. I think there is a small market correction atm, but Trump has stated he wants to hold 1mil in Bitcoin for the US reserve. He also wants to make the US the ""Crypto capital of the world."" I think the mf just wants to pump and dump on the international level. I bet Bitcoin gets to 200k by the end of his term. Analysts have said Bitcoin could hit 1 mil by 2030, but I didn't believe that until Trump started saying the shit he did.

Now, one of the biggest issues of crypto mining is the power usage. Please just google how much power it takes to mine bitcoin. a NYT article called out Riot for running mainly on fossil fuels (96%). Riot clapped back and said they use this that and the other thing adding up to 35% but conveniently didn't mention where the other majority of power was coming from. So I think it's safe to assume fossil fuels.

**All that is cool but what about it**

So Trump has talked about starting a trade war with like everyone. But for this research I specifically looked at China, Canada, and Mexico. The top 10 things mexico gives us in exports is fucking petroleum. Canada, Natural gas. China actually doesn't matter atm unless you want to big brain it and point at we get an asston of machinery from them and I would guess we get quite a few components used for bitcoin mining. I also looked at what we like to import and export with fossil fuels right. So we are actually at a point where we are producing more energy than we use and exporting more than importing. THAT BEING SAID, It's still going to hurt the energy department but we're not as reliant as I had initially assumed.

So, I learned that a lot of the energy we use here in the US to power our energy grids is fucking Natural Gas. Like, an asston. Check this graph out.

So the unfortunate news is I do believe that the energy is going to suffer a little bit which could in the short term completely backshot Riot industries causing a drop in the stock. However, I don't think that will happen because everyone is going to be buying up bitcoin and that stock since that's all they do.

[The red line is our exports - Blue imports](https://preview.redd.it/oknplw00c26e1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=17cae4ab6d5d780cca6ce16997882cc4900bf78a)

**So why should I trust you?**

Well let my banbet record speak for itself.

You shouldn't.

My track record is horrible but I want to explain myself. So historically, I'll browse this subreddit and see other people talking about a stock and what they think. I never put a lot of thought into it like I have this. This is my area of expertise. 

Side note, sorry to dude who posted the DD I bought calls and the stock immediately dumped now I'm bagholding .01 9$ calls for 12/20 so my b

**Since we've established that I am not trustworthy, here is why you shouldn't trust me using data**

So total revenue for my robinhood account is 3k down to 0, then up to 1k, now down to 500. If I stay away from options I make money. I bought SOFI when it was 4$, sold for a profit. Looked at Hut 8 mining almost two years ago at like 2-4$ whatever it was but wanted to play with options, now its 25$. Bought crypto made money on that. I just can't do options.

Please remember that, ""I Just cant do options.""

**Crypto is a scam**

Crypto is like literally an infinite money glitch. We all decide it has more value and poof it goes up. That doesn't work with fiat (I don't like the fiat system but that's not for here). It'll take one solar flare to bankrupt anyone who only has crypto assets.

I like the idea of crypto, but just logically speaking it doesn't do anything to buy it other than cause a shrinkage of it. Infinite money glitch.

**I've not been profitable on the stocks**

I actually mean just the market, but legit dude fr I can't make money gambling on options to save my life. You wanna know what I can make money on that I have more than once though? Fucking blackjack. I have gambled on blackjack this year on online casinos and have a net profit of at least 2k. I will not say the amount that I have won in it's entirety, but if there's anything I'm good at, it's knowing basic strategy at Blackjack. Right now, I'm staying away from the casino and trying a new side hustle because I got a part time job working in retail as a cashier. Life suck.

Side note from future me during my week ban, I've been sports betting with positive EV and have made 1500$ over the last seven days. That's more than I've earned on Robinhood since I made the account in 2020 as a 20 year old. I'm net negative 1500 on there according to the site. Also, I said ""future me"" because I've had this sitting in a draft that I occasionally have come back to edit.

**Why all that matter**

Remember what I said to remember? Well I am going to buy spy calls for the Fed meeting. I already have money allocated to it in robinhood. Good luck cause I usually lose when I buy calls.

A recession is coming. This next Administration is going to come with a recession and no I'm not saying that cause I'm mad I'm saying that because I believe it because the analysts believe it. That part about buying SPY calls though I 100% am considering depositing some money to buy some. Even with a recession I don't believe the crypto market will follow as long as Trump does the crypto shit he says he'll do.

**My Positions**

Here is my robinhood atm. I don't have as much money as everybody else just bear with me.

[I had to shrink the file down sorry for the grain](https://preview.redd.it/k5qsqwhta26e1.jpg?width=250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dfa3913214e5740487127ceb7df6c3d891008ff)

So I am going to buy and hold every stock that is literally just a company for mining bitcoin. I have already started and will use my oddsjam earnings to put into these stocks. I'm tired of being poor and want to prove myself here. I may be back for these companies earnings calls next year but we will see.

**Positions**

Positions are buy buy buy all crypto related stocks that mine. Buy Bitcoin too maybe even the ETF. I'm not sure yet if these stocks will boom and stay at high prices or not, but as of right now they are cheap. They will 100% double but whether or not they stay doubled, idk.

If you reverse me, buy puts on Riot. 

TLDR: Crypto boom. Stonks quiet. When crypto boom and double, SELL. When stonk red, buy stonk cause red is temporary green is forever.

If reverse me, Buy puts for the fed meeting and sell all of your crypto.

$RIVN is the new $CVNA ,"Let‚Äôs do a concise yet precise DD on this turd machine called $RIVN. 

I don‚Äôt want to go into too much details because I feel lazy as fuck and you‚Äôll eventually just yolo your money into some stupid short term option that will make you feel like you‚Äôre doing crack while going to $0. Burp. 

Bullish points 

- Gen 2 has a much more cost efficient build that was made very clear by CEO during last earning call. He even said ‚ÄúBlock the noise, we are having great progress with our Gen 2‚Ä¶‚Äù. If this turn out to be fake then I‚Äôll short it to $0 because using this terminology means business. If he can‚Äôt deliver or just lied then he toast. 

- The turnaround story must be real, they must be fighting every second of every day to reduce costs and survive. What did this kind of management behaviour gave as a result for $CVNA ? Don‚Äôt start to touch yourself i‚Äôm not done yet. 

- The market sentiment is almost at an all time low, and rightfully so as they navigate a bunch of problems they caused themselves by being kind of moronic. The bet here is that they will improve on that aspect and stop shooting themselves in the foot every 2 minutes. 

- The cars are loved by their owners, this is self explanatory, a great product will always win and everything will be done to avoid seing it disappear. 

- The new cars will be a massive catalyst up to their launch if you have the patience to hold for at least 1 full year. The R2 will be a best seller and will absolutely destroy the market in which it will be competing. I would 100% buy one if I could. 

- The cars are US made and in this case the US manufactures are not just fighting Tesla they‚Äôre fighting China and a tech US company going bankrupt will not fly with the Trump administration. 

Bearish points will be quick, we all know why it‚Äôs a turd 

- Not being gross margin profitable is a crazy achievement for any kind of respected company,  that‚Äôs some new regarded level of regardness. 

- They could fail on everything they‚Äôre trying to accomplish 

- R2 might just be an other turd machine that doesn‚Äôt fit in any market  

- Elon Musk is literally running the country and has people everywhere, maybe he‚Äôll just want to fuck with Rivian even if it‚Äôs a net negative for the US 


I have more to say but I just gave you bunch of regards way too much to read at once and I don‚Äôt want to fry the 2 remaining brain cells you still have up there. 

Give a like and subscribe ! Or, go fuck yourself "
TSLA MSTR COIN RACE TO 1000,"We have to admit it, regards won! Portfolio managers spending their whole life aiming for +5%/year got smoked by regards that did 10x in 1-2 years.

So what's the plan now? What's stopping these 3 to reach $1000 / share? Lets analyze them:

1. TSLA. At $1000/share it's \~3.2T valuation. Around 2.5x from here.

2. MSTR. At $1000/share it's \~225B valuation. Around 2.75x from here.

3. COIN. At $1000/share it's \~250B valuation. Around 3.3x from here.

Market cap wise, COIN or MSTR probably has the best chance here but perhaps TSLA goes on a NVDA run to $1000/share.

So if we know this then what's the play for regards? Double leveraged of course!

TSLL @ 29. At 5x TSLL would be 150, probably more like 135 with decay.

MSTU @ 134. At 5.5x MSTU would be 737, probably more like 600 with decay.

CONL @ 55. At 6.6x CONL would be 360, probably more like 300 with decay.

"
CureVac DD,"Firstly, look at the chart.



It's got a classic smiley face formation; this is a very bullish indicator. Other stocks (which I'm not going to mention because it got my post removed last time) had a similar graph before its runup, and so did many other stocks with big run-ups recently.

Secondly, there is a DD written about it on this subreddit which wasn't written by ChatGPT. That is another clear indicator that this stock will do well, just like some others.  

Thirdly, it's up 12% in the past week - decent momentum.

Fourthly, and perhaps more importantly, they are trading at an incredibly cheap valuation.  

* Their TTM Net Income is $123 million, and this isn't one-time non-operating income; this is one-time operating income, and therefore more likely to recur in the future.  

* In addition, they had $145 million in R&D expenses, which really shouldn't be considered expenses but rather investments, since R&D expenses can be turned off at any time. 

This makes for a total of around $268 million. And when excluding R&D expenses, they have been profitable for a long time, and are still growing, but are down since 2021. 

For comparison, their market cap is ~~$681 million~~ $745 million and their enterprise value is ~~$78 million~~ $125 million (I started writing this DD last week and it's grown 12% since then); if they continue making money at this rate, you will get your money back in 3 years or less - 33% annual growth. And likely much more, since the enterprise value is the more relevant metric; potentially 200% annual growth if they're aggressive enough with buybacks.

And if there's another major virus, it will likely make 2021 income levels ($959 million R&D expenses + $-486 million net income = $491 million earnings before R&D). 

Fair value would probably be around 4x as high as it currently is, and from momentum it could potentially reach up to 2x fair value for a total gain of 8x.

What They Do:

CureVac is an mRNA vaccine company. Their main competitor is Moderna, which has a market cap of $17.5 billion and is unprofitable (although once you remove R&D expenses, they are admittedly much more profitable than CureVac, but the profit difference is not large enough to justify the difference in market cap and certainly isn't enough to justify the difference in enterprise value). mRNA technology demonstrated its potential during the pandemic, when it helped rapidly develop vaccines to combat a novel virus. CureVac failed to create an effective enough vaccine during the pandemic, which resulted in the large stock price declines over the past few years; the reason for this is that they used unmodified natural mRNA which was less stable in the body, whereas Moderna used a modified varient. They have changed their approach in recent years, resulting in a 1.45 billion euro deal with GlaxoSmithKline, a major British pharma company.  
See [this article\(https://www.labiotech.eu/in-depth/curevac-gsk-deal-mrna/) for more information (I didn't write it but did use it for research).

Risks:

* Robert F Kennedy Jr - the risk is overblown because he's going to in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services, not the FDA, and therefore will not have the authority to ban their vaccines

* Competition from Moderna - Moderna has a much larger cash pile so can spend more on research and development; however, CureVac can still get some market share and has some patents (though some of them have recently been invalidated); plus if necessary, they can borrow money for R&D.

Positions: 13% of my portfolio in CVAC shares"
Coin is going UP," First of all, Coinbase is an excellent stock which profits on directional movement of crypto regardless of direction. They make money either way because they're the real-life banker in Monopoly.  

Indicators:

Now, Coinbase is currently trading at $319.11, as I write this, with 

-STRONG support at $315.37 as well as a support zone starting at $306.30 to $307.57 as well as another support zone from $313.30 to $315.72. 

-STOCH RSI crossed into bullish territory at 1 10 p.m. today. 

-RSI made a bullish cross at the same point in time. 

-Volume: selling pressure decreasing as buying pressure increases.

-OBV BULLISH: OBV increasing with price increase

I personally hypothesize that Coinbase is going to break its highs, and I'm setting my biggest take profit at $378, in which 50% of my position will be liquidated. Additionally, I'm setting my second take profit at $363.87, during which I will liquidate 30% of my position. And finally, my first take profit will be at $339.62, which has been an area of support and resistance over the past few days. Currently, I think Coinbase is going to break its daily high of $321.17 in the very short future. Additionally, I project it breaking through the resistance around $322.56 as well. My stop loss is going to be set at $305.25, just below the second area of support. As if it breaks this, we are in bearish territory.

Do your own research and never risk more than what you are able and willing to lose in any investment. Please view it on your own charts as well to avoid risk of seizures. 

You asked me to tell you ahead of time when I predict a breakout‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have a crystal ball and I cannot see the future, but I can add up what various indicators say and cross check them and come up with my own conclusion. I urge you to do the same.

Thank you, and good luck. Price is $319.01 as I write this. 

My current positions for the week are shown. Closed last week with a hefty profit. 

I am also bullish on BITX, MARA & RDDT - but do your own research please."
"Here's why I'm shorting Soundhound, a current WSB darling","Alright, degenerates, let‚Äôs talk about SOUN. If you‚Äôve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats ‚Äì I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here‚Äôs the thing: stocks don‚Äôt just go up forever, and Soundhound‚Äôs hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money ‚Äì big money ‚Äì by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I‚Äôm about to tell you. [Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares](https://imgur.com/a/5qWs8Sp)

**Tl;dr:**

* At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever.
* Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound‚Äôs integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record.
* Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business‚ÄîAmelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue
* Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle

# Despite misleading headlines of ‚Äúrecord‚Äù growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining

Soundhound reported ‚Äúrecord‚Äù Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year ‚Äì but failed to mention that **all** of this ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, **Soundhound‚Äôs business declined \~9%.**

Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired ***is also declining***). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get \~$44.7M.¬†

[Amelia Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/o6mvsq4dav5e1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=53f34074638912ededf539313815c93fb003f2b7)

We don‚Äôt have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn‚Äôt any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you‚Äôre familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but **Amelia is actually not a SaaS business**, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it‚Äôs fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be \~$22M (50% \* $44.7M).¬†

Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize \~58% of Amelia‚Äôs Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, **$13M (58% \* $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.**¬†

Backing this out of Soundhound‚Äôs ‚Äúrecord‚Äù Q3 revenue, we can see that **the organic Soundhound business generated just \~$12M, declining \~9% year-over-year.**

[Soundhound Q3 Growth](https://preview.redd.it/yu7yewcf5v5e1.png?width=287&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a4772913c6de5115fd73ae89163d65190b96187)

Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can‚Äôt believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn‚Äôt widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it‚Äôs wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn‚Äôt - you‚Äôre not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it‚Äôs wrong is because in this case, **revenue for** **both** **Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!**¬†

Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue **will decline by a staggering 27% YoY**. This isn‚Äôt a growth story; it‚Äôs a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting.

[Soundhound Q4 guidance](https://preview.redd.it/tdflfz1j5v5e1.png?width=296&format=png&auto=webp&s=c27f8baa8ce37100bf9ab74aad5af901f0ffef70)

When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don‚Äôt just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - **95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.**¬†

[Soundhound revenue by type](https://preview.redd.it/ruxcyb0s5v5e1.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f2a5ffd325ab2615d2c0831f31a879b92cebb19)

This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.¬†

# Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue

Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this ‚Äúgrowth,‚Äù is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia‚Äôs has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.¬†

Don‚Äôt take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia‚Äôs ‚Äúconversational AI‚Äù is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their [website](https://www.americanheritagecu.org/), click Live Chat, and you‚Äôll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here‚Äôs how my conversation went:¬†

[Amelia Chat](https://preview.redd.it/r5ujc4en6v5e1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb43d5aff2e3d3fb7da62ce343c93c9c2574cd12)

Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn‚Äôt answer basic questions like ‚ÄúWhat are some things you can help me with?‚Äù. **This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.**¬†

Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai [website ](https://olukai.com/pages/contact)and clicking ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù. Here‚Äôs how my conversation went:¬†

[Sierra chat](https://preview.redd.it/b7txd7lq6v5e1.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=088bfe0c601b8be9afd42b1acb3d6c2ecd3430e6)

The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn‚Äôt the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there‚Äôs also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.¬†

None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.¬†

But, let‚Äôs suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, **why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations?** That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.¬†

None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn‚Äôt for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it‚Äôs also \~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound‚Äôs financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here‚Äôs the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger:

https://preview.redd.it/icz23hx07v5e1.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=95b6f256e0975d1efcbd30088077176ed268f551

In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of \~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound‚Äôs revenue, good or bad. And I think it‚Äôs bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. **Amelia‚Äôs cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!**¬†

Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia‚Äôs margins are so terrible is because **they don‚Äôt sell very much software**, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here‚Äôs the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:¬†

[Amelia revenue by type](https://preview.redd.it/hfmpse697v5e1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=8347bb1b070988f4e2b28a5fc51760fa07978b9c)

The vast majority of revenue came from ‚ÄúSubscription‚Äù, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. **The reason they‚Äôre not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report,** so they‚Äôve combined it with services and called the whole thing ‚ÄúSubscription‚Äù.¬†

Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia‚Äôs gross margin of 30%.¬†

# Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk

Soundhound isn‚Äôt a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.¬†

Adding to the problem is customer concentration: **62% of Soundhound‚Äôs revenue comes from just two automotive customers**, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound‚Äôs revenue will crater.

https://preview.redd.it/lwhmohjk7v5e1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=684e25adcd9bcb7a1aa1d565549e32196a4c429e

Worse, only 15% of Soundhound‚Äôs revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound‚Äôs revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, **Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers.**

https://preview.redd.it/zgvxxjan7v5e1.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f3483c49c95c31b3f348a3f0a1f8f49bd1f87d5

# The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO

If you‚Äôve been riding the SOUN hype train, you‚Äôre probably thinking: ‚ÄúBut what about Nvidia!‚Äù And sure, Nvidia‚Äôs name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here‚Äôs the cold, hard truth: this ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance.

Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound ‚Äì just 1.7M common shares ‚Äì but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a [private $75M venture round](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/soundhound-raises-75m-to-bring-its-voice-enabled-ai-everywhere/), long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound‚Äôs [2021 de-SPAC process](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840856/000121390021059758/ea150505ex99-2_archimedes.htm), yet retail investors and media only took notice when [Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000021/xslForm13F_X02/information_table.xml) report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day.

https://preview.redd.it/3o6rpulq7v5e1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=224e650fcb4281072d203301362e0f74fdb2a786

Prior to this, the **one and only time** NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound‚Äôs earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 ‚Äústrategic‚Äù investors, NVIDIA among them:

https://preview.redd.it/0y6gvezt7v5e1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=379365fe89c9d7410816d3ea0dc662c10d27180e

Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240318067099/en/) about its integration with Nvidia‚Äôs DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, **Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times**, describing the ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù as a ‚Äúvery big milestone‚Äù for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù as new, **Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023** based on a trip to the Wayback machine

[NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023](https://preview.redd.it/4toe71qx7v5e1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=a596eeddf44e08e19aaf7dd7c321a3d886ad4ea1)

But let‚Äôs examine the facts. [Nvidia‚Äôs DRIVE platform](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/partners/) is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It‚Äôs not an exclusive club. Nvidia‚Äôs DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, **including Soundhound‚Äôs closest competitor** (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a [blog post](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/cerence-generative-ai-in-car-experience/) showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform ‚Äì something it hasn‚Äôt done for Soundhound. **If this ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù were truly transformative, wouldn‚Äôt Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly?**

[NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current \(Cerence\)](https://preview.redd.it/c0iczsy28v5e1.png?width=1415&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a889071b541ebc556505e51c7e2a5b0ec9e2ec)

The reality is, Soundhound‚Äôs integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn‚Äôt a deep, strategic relationship ‚Äì it‚Äôs a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn‚Äôt move the needle for Nvidia. **Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story.**

This isn‚Äôt a transformative partnership; it‚Äôs an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it‚Äôs worth. Don‚Äôt fall for the hype.

# Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher)

In its [press release](https://www.soundhound.com/newsroom/press-releases/soundhound-ai-acquires-amelia-significantly-expanding-its-scale-and-reach-in-conversational-ai-across-new-verticals-and-hundreds-of-enterprise-brands/) announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as ‚Äú$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia‚Äôs debt, as well as future earnout potential‚Ä¶‚Äù

While there‚Äôs nothing wrong with this statement, it‚Äôs unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn‚Äôt the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/zv6qjd798v5e1.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1b556d4a600df16dfc48a0a38d59c79ce40bf64

The details can be found in the [stock purchase agreement](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/121390024066351/2?cik=1840856), but here‚Äôs the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices)

This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound‚Äôs selective disclosure of Amelia‚Äôs cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts.

# Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards

I won‚Äôt spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there‚Äôs an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound

Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that‚Äôs how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).¬†

We don‚Äôt know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that‚Äôs what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.¬†

With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x.

For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you‚Äôre getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir‚Äôs biggest customer. With Soundhound, you‚Äôre getting boomer-tech that‚Äôs trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.

Quantum Computing Inc is going to crash,"Context: Quantum computing is having its moment. It‚Äôs risky, but could massively disrupt industries in areas like computing, finance and cyber security. But stock market bubbles are forming. 

Quantum computing is probably the most technically difficult industry for analysts to assess. Few people are equipped with an adequate understanding of quantum technologies, which is leading to massive mispricing. 

Quantum Computing Inc is junk

Iceberg Research‚Äôs recent short report covers some of them. They note that the firm has run from one fad to another (chips, ai, computing) and failed at each. They list several misleading claims that they‚Äôve made and withdrawn. The report is damning and raises serious questions about the future of the company, I encourage you all to read it. 

However Iceberg does not go far enough.

https://iceberg-research.com/2024/11/27/quantum-computing-inc-the-phantom-chip-foundry/

They lack talent. Successful quantum innovations requires strong technical knowledge that you really can only come by in either leading universities or megacap firms like google. 

I went through the Linkedin profiles of each of their employees and compared them with their small cap competitors. I tallied up the share of employees that went to an Edu Rank top-100 world universities for Quantum Physics (which is a very broad net), they rank incredibly poorly among it‚Äôs peers - less than a fifth of employees (see picture)*. This is robust to different ranking metrics. Counting only Ivy leagues they come out much worse.

But look, not all employees are on linkedin. And this is the next big underdog? No. 

A large share of their ‚Äútalent‚Äù comes from the Steven‚Äôs Institute of Technology, an unremarkable university in New Jersey (ranked 150+ for Quantum Physics depending on list) 

The company‚Äôs Chief Quantum Officer is Yuping Huang. On first glance he appears to have a prolific publishing history; however, most papers receive low citations and/or he is third, fourth or fifth author. Huang was previously sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary duties when he merged his previous company with Quantum Computing Inc. Notably he is both a director and employee, which is a big corporate governance redflag (reminds me of Cassava Sciences). 

There is only one independent director with a background in Quantum Physics to provide checks and balance on Huang ‚Äî Dr Javad Shabani. He is not up to the task. His publishing history is mediocre. 

Looking deeper, the Chief Technology Officer Yong Meng Sua, has an even more mediocre publishing history. And has only risen to an Assistant Professor role at Steven‚Äôs. He spends much of his time discussing esoteric computing questions tangential to his work (i.e. the NP=P problem, see their LinkedIn posts)

And finally the Director of the Company‚Äôs chip foundry (Iceberg has raised significant questions about the foundry). Dr Milan Begliarbekov after finishing high school enrolled in a bachelor‚Äôs degree in English literature at Steven‚Äôs, graduated, then immediately enrolled in a physics Phd at Steven‚Äôs. Either he is a savant polymath who is able to pick up grad school physics level math, or a Phd from Steven‚Äôs is worthless. His publishing career is very mediocre. 

These scientists will not crack the major problems stopping widespread commercialization of Quantum tech. Simply compare their publishing records to the founder at Ion-Q (Peter Chapman) or leading quantum scientists at Google, alongside the significant and verifiable technological advancements these companies have made. 

Another clue that something is amiss is headcount. Rigetti has three fold the number of employees. D-Wave six fold. All have similar market cap. What‚Äôs driving value? We‚Äôve established that it‚Äôs not human capital. Iceberg‚Äôs research reveals it‚Äôs not intellectual property or physical capital either. 

So why has it done so well?  Regarded retail investors.

Only 3.3% of Quantum Computing Inc is held by institutional investors (and falling). Compared with ~40% for IONQ. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qubt/institutional-holdings

The lack of institutional investment while institutional investors are simultaneously clamouring to load up on quantum stocks is a massive red flag. In fact no Wall Street analysts track them. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/quantum-computing-qubt-stock-skyrockets-short-sellers-are-lurking

So what happens next? 

The 800% rise in one month is going to attract short selling interest as people realise it‚Äôs junk. The stock will fall back below $1. 

Risk:
If you want to short/buy puts, You can rest assured that the company is not going to suddenly become profitable. The main risk comes from why they‚Äôve done so well, despite having little revenue, expertise, or innovation to show for it.

They‚Äôre literally called Quantum Computing Incorporated. If you‚Äôre a full regard wanting to invest in Quantum computing are you going to invest in IonQ (what?), Rigetti (spaghetti company?) or a company conveniently called Quantum Computing? It‚Äôs a regard trap. 

It‚Äôs like being interested in electric cars and passing on Tesla because you wanted to invest in a stock called Electric Car Co. 

My positions

1000 put contracts to sell @$4.50, cost average = 0.11, expiring Dec 20. If this doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôm going to buy puts again and again. This company sucks. "
$GOOG the BFTG,"
Regards, grab your tendies and gather around the fire because I‚Äôm going to tell you all about *$GOOG* (aka Alphabet) the BFTG (Big Fucking ~~Tech~~ Tendie Giant). I‚Äôll break it down for you because I know you polish that üß† real nice so I can‚Äôt expect a single wrinkle. 

1. Criminally Low P/E Ratio

While all your other tech darlings are flexing P/E ratios like a hooker in heat, $GOOGL is at 23.4 P/E ratio.

For reference:
* $SPX: >27 P/E (yes, the S&P500)
* $MSFT: >36 P/E
* $AAPL: >39 P/E
* $NVDA: >56 P/E
* $AMZN: >47 P/E
* $TSLA: >106 P/E (Fuck you, for the window lickers in the back)

Remember a ‚Äúgood‚Äù P/E ratio is traditionally around 20-25. If you don‚Äôt understand then read a fucking book.

2. AI Incumming

Sure, everyone‚Äôs talking about OpenAI and ChatGPT, but who‚Äôs making real money here? Google owns 90%+ of search traffic (when did you ever hear ‚Äúyahoo it‚Äù or ‚Äúask duck duck go‚Äù?) and monetizes it like a legal cartel. Once Gemini (+Legacy Bard) gets some improvements and a little lipstick even MORE money. Oh, and don‚Äôt forget Google Cloud, which grew revenues 30% YoY last quarter.

3. Santa Rally - Ho Ho Hold Onto Your Bollocks üéÖ

Historically, December is green season for big-cap tech. Funds rebalance, and retail apes are YOLOing. The Santa Rally isn‚Äôt just a meme; it‚Äôs a statistical goldmine. With $GOOG‚Äôs recent earnings beat ($28.5B in 3 months), the market‚Äôs about to price this in as snow starts falling.

4. Big Tech = Safe Haven

Recession? Inflation? Global chaos? Who cares. Big Tech don‚Äôt give a *FUCK*. Ad spending may wobble, but companies will NEVER stop buying Google ads.

5. Buybacks on Steroids

$GOOGL has a $70 BILLION buyback program active, the best part? They‚Äôre buying low and will push us even higher.

TL;DR: Google Is The Perfect Combo of Value & Growth.

Adobe Earnings Play,everything is in the chart + bullish macd crossover in the daily timeframe = balls deep in calls 
SMCI loose analysis and opportunity simmering ,"SMCI golden age and beautiful chart. 

After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent! Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock! It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud. Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team. 

We just saw in the last month of 72% rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around $48, the last critical level we saw was $49.

Also, it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming. My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. 

Fundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. 

There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs.

I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress. Next pull back I‚Äôm buying calls with a strike price of about $49-$55 exp in March. Even considering a YOLO. God Speed to the investors and traders. "
My thesis on INTC going into 2025,"I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30

I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed.

Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs.

In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now.

It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering.

However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act.

TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of.

So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants.

I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025.

If you got this far, thank you for reading.

EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit."
CVNA puts for next week,"Alright regards, let me preface this by saying NO ONE SHOULD DO THIS.  This is a dumb idea, and I will likely lose.  I bought puts on CVNA at close on Friday.  If you want to see my past plays, check my profile.  I called the MRNA bounce, the NVDA sell off, the NKE bounce, but the UPST one was a bit off(still think it‚Äôll happen).  

Why would i do something so dumb?  Because I like spotting trend reversals as they‚Äôre happening.  On the daily chart, you can clearly see the trend line break today.  The MACD is turning over, the RSI is dropping even though we‚Äôre still near the short term top, and that is a very convincing red candle on the daily.  

On the 30 minute, you can see the aggressive break more clearly, but more importantly to me is the fact that the 50 day and 100 day EMA‚Äôs have crossed to the downside for the first time since August 30.  That is fucking crazy that it took that long for that to happen.  IMO that is a very bearish signal that I am not going to ignore.  

I‚Äôm not going to go into CVNA‚Äôs financials or practices or the fact that they inflate their GPPU.  There are SO many DD‚Äôs about how it‚Äôs overvalued and a scam company.  Everyone knows that, but it just continues its stupid melt up.  That is, until next week.  I‚Äôm hoping other traders see this and decide to start selling/shorting this bitch into oblivion.  They probably won‚Äôt tho and my contracts will expire worthless, but we‚Äôll see.

One thing to note;  CVNA‚Äôs delinquencies are at 12.6% and rising.  Their partner, Ally financial, warn in September that their delinquencies on auto loans was 20 bps higher than expected.  That‚Äôs significant.  Ally‚Äôs stock took a hit for that but CVNA didn‚Äôt because CVNA is not on the hook for the trash loans they sell to Ally.  However, Ally can increase their underwriting standards and make it harder for CVNA to give loans to every regard with a pulse.  Honestly this smells a lot like mortgages in 2008.  Eventually this will blow up, it‚Äôs just a matter of when.  And I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôll blow up this week.  I just like the technical setup.  

In closing, this is stupid and no one should do this.  But I like a challenge, and I like being right.  I only have 3 $240 puts so far, I may get more Monday.  It‚Äôs not a big bet at all, but i want some skin in the game so I can say I‚Äôm right if it plays out how I think it will.  Not financial advice, and do not tail me unless you‚Äôre ok with losing what you put in.  "
Help Analyzing The ODP Corporation,"Finding value in this market seems near impossible. But, I think I may have found a cigar butt ‚Äî Office Depot. Here‚Äôs my back of the envelope math that I‚Äôm hoping y‚Äôall can help fill out a little more. This is just a primer to get the convo flowing. Please keep it civil, factual, and support assertions with numbers/facts. Please. 

In 2015 staples tried to purchased Office Depot for $6.3b, but the deal was killed by the FTC. They tried again in 2021 offering $2.1b. This got me wondering, why? Where‚Äôs the value? Well, there may be a little. 

ODP is comprised of Four business units: 1) ODP Business Solutions, LLC (B2B); 2) Office Depot, LLC (retail); 3) Veyer, LLC (logistics); and 4) Varis, Inc. (digital procurement). 

 The latter 2 are interesting and showed  decent growth: Veyer (25%) and Varis (14%). ODP ‚Äúsold‚Äù most of Varis but still owns about 20%. They actually paid the buyer to take it off their hands (this plays a small role in my broader thesis of why ODP NEEDS to sell, the leadership is totally incompetent). 

The company is shrinking, and rapidly. But they have $181mm in cash. Net income of $139mm. Receivables are $487mm. Inventory $765mm. They own real estate that‚Äôs worth about $86mm (but hard to confirm). $1.04B in debt. Total liabilities of 2.785B. Current market cap is $779mm. 

Removing debt from the equation, conservatively I put the value around $1.1b. That‚Äôs a 41% delta/upside. 

But, factoring in debt, it‚Äôs a different picture (obviously). They‚Äôve manage to decrease their interest expense every year, going from $89mm in 2019 to $20mm in 2023. They recently restructured their revolver and the new maturity date is 2029, so they have time. There‚Äôs also a $250mm accordion allowing them to increase the loan from $800mm to $1.05b. 

The logistics component (veyer) seems interesting and promising but it sounds like they‚Äôre looking may be unhappy with Norman‚Äôs there as well ‚Äî again just really poor management. 

EBITDA: $417mm
Adjusted: $131mm

Nasdaq 100 change happening any day now - trigger for $PLTR and $MSTR,"Tell me if I'm wrong - but any day now, maybe even TONIGHT after market close - Nasdaq will announce the annual changes to the Nasdaq 100 index. Last year it happened Friday the 8th of December - coming into effect Monday 18/12.  Source: [https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/annual-changes-to-the-nasdaq-100-indexr-2023-12-08](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/annual-changes-to-the-nasdaq-100-indexr-2023-12-08)

Palantir was last time I checked the 18th biggest company on Nasdaq after the list change a few weeks ago. Should be the same for Microstrategy - nr 22 or something. Some of it is likely priced in but since QQQ following ETFs etc cannot buy until the actual date, should be a strong trigger for both companies when they need to scoop up shares. What do you think?

Eli Lilly (LLY): Dominating the Obesity Market with Innovation and Expansion,"About LLY

Eli Lilly and Company, founded in 1876 and headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, develops and markets pharmaceuticals globally. Key products include diabetes treatments (e.g., Humalog, Jardiance, Trulicity), obesity drugs (e.g., Zepbound), oncology medications (e.g., Verzenio, Alimta), and therapies for autoimmune and neurological conditions (e.g., Olumiant, Taltz, Emgality). The company also offers Cialis for erectile dysfunction and Forteo for osteoporosis. Lilly operates the Lilly Seaport Innovation Center focused on RNA/DNA-based therapies and collaborates with various biotech firms.


Strong Market Position and Research Successes

Recent comparative study results have shown that Zepbound outperforms its competitor Wegovy from Novo Nordisk, achieving a 20.2% weight loss over 72 weeks, compared to Wegovy‚Äôs 13.7%. These findings further strengthen Eli Lilly's competitive position in the obesity treatment market, where it's facing tough competition from Novo Nordisk. The company‚Äôs expanded production capacity, including resolving the tirzepatide shortage, puts it in a great position to speed up its market share growth.

Growth Strategy and Production Expansion

Lilly continues to heavily invest in boosting its production capacity, committing an additional $2 billion to its Lilly Medicine Foundry project, increasing its earlier investment of $4.5 billion. The company‚Äôs focus on penetrating the U.S. market, introducing single-dose vials, and strategically expanding its production capabilities highlights its commitment to meeting the rapidly growing demand for GLP-1 products. Solving the tirzepatide availability issue also reduces competition from compounded drugs.

Distribution Channels and Innovations

Lilly has a strong drug distribution network in the obesity and diabetes treatment space, with promising candidates like retatrutide (24% weight loss in 48 weeks) and orforglipron (nearly 10% weight loss in 36 weeks). These next-gen products could help Lilly maintain its leadership position as the GLP-1 market grows and new competitors enter the scene.

**Why write this?**  ¬†

* I feel like we need a solid fucking company.
* I get too scared to buy aviation, nuclear, and crypto stocks.
* They weren‚Äôt listed on WSB‚Äôs Earnings board.
* I thought more people would like the YOLO.
* They POSSIBLY gave me a backpack when I was MAYBE working with them eight years ago.

**DD Research**

**What is Rubrik ?**¬†

* Rubrik is a backup & recovery provider that sits on top of a company‚Äôs cloud infrastructure.

**What is an example of Backup & Recovery I can maybe understand?**¬†

* You drop your phone under a tire because you were to busy while parking, leading to a smashing of both it and the SIM card. The only fix is you buy a new phone, login with your iCloud email, and everything is restored from the cloud.
* Rubrik does the above and sells at-cost servers from partners like Dell, HPE, SMCI, etc. They protect data in places like AWS , Azure, and GCP.
* People pay whatever when they have no phone or car. Same here.

**How are you qualified?**¬†

* I worked at a research company for five years partnering with SaaS vendors $5M-$250M, for two of those years I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY they may have been a client.
* I transitioned to Software Engineering three years ago from Tech Sales. I have tracked them and understand both the sales pitch and technology pitch.¬†
* I saw them masterfully navigate researchers, which they still do, and become the golden child. Billions of dollars get validated by researchers.... it's importants.
   * [(Updated) They Poached the Magic in 2018](https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/01/rubrik_gartner_hires/). One is doable but not three of them it delayed the research paper a year that doesn‚Äôt happen unless a research analyst dies.
   * [(Updated) Because of 2018 poaching the late Fall report never got published (major delay), The 2019 Report Was Fought Back By Rubrik for Flawed Data](https://www.crn.com/news/storage/rubrik-ceo-gartner-data-center-magic-quadrant-seriously-flawed)¬†. I've never seen a CEO do this without blowback Bipul again with a killer move.
   * TL:DR; They were making moves YEARS ago. See article excerpt below.

[This is pretty rare, vendors complain but not publishing a document read by 4k+ CIO controlling the flow of billions of dollars in a sector. It's just insane. There's a lot of big names backing them. ](https://preview.redd.it/x3hcumds365e1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f1e26b7a5f66134efaf4447b77fa18f020f0837)

**Who‚Äôs in the market? Competitors?**¬†

https://preview.redd.it/qq3hhafdg55e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20d4d8a57db7467d15ffd2abaa24459d6ac8d60c

* Their only publicly traded competitor is Commvault which is around $170 and dropping.
* Veeam and Cohesity are private firms with very different architectures, support qualities, and applications. Rubrik is the only one fully doing what it does. They are considered the ‚ÄúLexus‚Äù

**How are they different?**¬†

* Rubrik views backup and recovery very differently from legacy vendors. They built their architecture based on expecting to get hacked (Backup & Recovery) vs. trying to prevent a hack (Incident Response). It's never been done ""their way"" before.
* Rubrik creates an air gapped layer on top of databases that - even if a hacker gets in they‚Äôre quarantined and the user can restore the system cutting them off.¬†Thus less downtime, less support costs, payroll, legal fees, etc.
* They are very partner friendly with Mandiant, Crowdstrike, and Zscaler at least in the cutthroat cyber industry.¬†
* Rubrik‚Äôs leadership , in particular the CEO Bipul Sinha, are not run of the mill. Bipul is personally a very kind, measured, and calculated leader, I‚Äôve met him before. He‚Äôs a lovely man but a killer. He‚Äôs an engineer with a sales streak like Elon. Bipul has Nutanix and Bromium under his belt. Google Him. He essentially came out of retirement for this company from a cushy ass VC job.¬†
* They know how to pitch investors, analysts, sales people, clients, basically everyone. They‚Äôre as buttoned up as you get and they come to impress. They earned their street cred 100%.¬†
* They have consistently ranked as #1 according to Gartner in the Magic Quadrant. Beating out companies with very, very large balance sheets that don't have the balls to IPO in 2024.

**Why the sudden pop? (Things I thought were important)**¬†

* Analysts needed another leap to profitability¬† due to the only available historicals¬† being from the April 2024 IPO and September Q2 earnings. This gave them pause on profitability as Rubrik as high operating margin.
* They raised 2025 Guidance. Indicated profitability by end of next year on this Q3 Earnings.
* Things I Heard on their Q3 Earnings today:
   * They mentioned a Fortune 50 Healthcare company selecting them in a competitive win. UnitedHealthcare was hacked in February and had offline billing systems for like 20 days. I‚Äôm thinking they signed UNH, that‚Äôs a big cookie boys. It‚Äôs super fucking hard to rip and replace a legacy vendor.¬†
   * They passed $1B in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). This is a big metric. I heard both the Goldman Sachs and Barclays analysts say ‚ÄúCongrats‚Äù they seemed to be teeing up easier questions.¬†¬†¬†
* [Everyone and their mother in Cybersecurity has heard of Rubrik. They got the same award as Google, Facebook, and others a month ago for Entrepreneurship](https://www.rubrik.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/24/rubrik-named-the-2024-entrepreneurial-company-of-the-year-by-the-harvard-business-school-hbs-association-of-northern-california)¬†

* **April 24th 2024 IPO Financials**
   * ¬†Rubrik reveals a very high operating margin due to sales and marketing investments aka ripping out Zscaler‚Äôs sales team doing the ‚ÄúSalesforce‚Äù push. Blitzkreg the market.¬†
   * I believe they started¬† planning ripping Zscaler in October 2023 , it takes time to ramp up. They probably got all big sales hires in by March with a six month ramp up take lands sales quotes around September when the stock crept up(

* **Septemeber 9th 2024 Q2 Earnings Financials**¬†
   * Earnings were month after the late July 2024 Crowdstrike hack, I do not think Rubrik was able to accelerate deal velocity to report ARR high enough to relieve market analysts and critics of the operating margin. They were asked about ‚Äúdeal velocity‚Äù by analysts today and it seems like the markets are pleased.¬†
   * [Bloomberg video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGvI0QbzzkY) from post-earnings is killer and a good recap of market sentiment.
   * [Rubrik Search Trends Peaked In April Coinciding With the Major UNH Hack; however, they droped off after the huge spike.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=rubrik&hl=en)
      * I think analysts expected a quicker deal cycle around the UNH hack, 4 months/120 days is a very fast enterprise sales cycle. Most large sales deals can take 6-12 months if not longer.
* **October 2024:**¬†
   * I believe deal velocity picked up from the UNH hack and even with low search results, the three week hack fallout was enough to start sales cycles. Then from the Crowdstrike fallout, even as a partner, highlighted the need to immediately solve it as publicly traded companies were literally offline, no one working.
   * Remember 60-120 days is a very fast sales cycle on any software sale. I think this is where we started heating up here as this is three months out from the hack.¬†¬†
   * Today on earnings analysts seemed eager to ask about profitability as the CFO and CEO were comfortable to voice the 2026 is the year. Look there's alot of tech companies with -40 EPS floating around. It's not 2013-2018 you can't float on negative earnings and millions of users. <--- the market is speaking, you have to make money as a tech company.
* **November 2024:**¬†
   * Rising cybersecurity risk from election, TikTok hack, etc. Fidelity even paused my money for four weeks in a CMA because they had security issues with fraud.¬†
   * Stock was ticking up.
* **December 4th, 2024  (Yesterday):**
   * Veeam $2B announcement mentioned earlier.
   * Volume doubles to nearly 2M. It was 700k in July 2024. It's 4M Today. Nuts.

**Where will it go?**

* It seem comparable to Zscaler and Commvault in valuation. I'm long on it and believe it'll push past $100 by July 2025."
"DD: Long China ETFs (YINN, CHAU) + PDD Calls ‚Äì Stimulus Incoming üöÄüöÄ","**TL;DR:** China is expected to announce significant economic stimulus measures during the **Central Economic Work Conference** on **December 11-12, 2024**. This anticipation has led to substantial call option activity in Chinese leveraged ETFs **YINN** and **CHAU**. I'm bullish on these ETFs and **PDD** calls, aiming to capitalize on the potential market surge. üêâ

**The Setup:**

1. **Stimulus Anticipation:** The Chinese government is poised to unveil major economic stimulus initiatives during the upcoming Central Economic Work Conference. Historically, such announcements have positively impacted Chinese markets.
2. **Unusual Options Activity:**
   * **YINN:** Over 98,000 call options with a $27 strike price expiring in January 2026 were traded recently, with an additional 38,000 calls traded shortly after. [GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2620900/unusual-surge-in-call-options-for-chinese-etfs-chau-and-yinn?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
   * **CHAU:** More than 200,000 call options, allowing the purchase of 20 million shares at $15 each by mid-May next year, totaling $55 million, have been bought. This is notable given CHAU's usual low options trading volume. [GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2620900/unusual-surge-in-call-options-for-chinese-etfs-chau-and-yinn?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**The Technicals:**

2. **Improving U.S.-China Relations:** Recent diplomatic engagements have eased tensions, potentially benefiting Chinese equities.

**Risks:**

* **Underwhelming Stimulus:** If the announced measures fall short of expectations, markets may react negatively.
* **Geopolitical Tensions:** Ongoing issues, such as potential U.S. regulatory changes affecting Chinese companies, could impact stock performance.
* **Market Volatility:** Leveraged ETFs like YINN and CHAU can experience significant price swings.

**My Position:**

* **YINN Calls:** Jan 17th 30 strike at $2.45
* **PDD Calls:** Jan 17th $120 strike at $1.0

This is a sure thing

[Dumped my entire TFSA into PDD yesterday](https://i.imgur.com/ileUaxN.png)

As a guy in his 20s, this TFSA is (basically) all I got. Spent years building this account. I tossed everything in there.

###DD

Am pure-blooded Chinese. Grew up in canada. Moved back to China last year.

Many of you ass clowns subscribe to the concept that Chinese have small dicks. Honestly that‚Äôs cool, but if you subscribe to that, then you must also subscribe to the fact that chinese have high IQs

PDD has about 14k employees. It is amongst the elite of the elite companies to work at, especially for fresh chinese college grads. China has 1.4 billion people.

Imagine a high IQ country of 1.4 billion people, now imagine 14k of the highest IQ people out of those 1.4 billion high IQ people working at a single company, and you got PDD.

###China‚Äôs 996 work culture

996 means 9am - 9pm, 6 days a week. Basically a 70-hour work week. It‚Äôs extremely toxic, but undoubtedly the most competitive work model in the world.

Imagine a company of people with average IQ of 135, all working 70 hours a week. Imagine the competitiveness of such an organization.

Temu‚Äôs tremendous growth is no surprise. Temu is the fastest growth e-commerce marketplace for a good fucking reason. Like I mentioned, it‚Äôs built by an organization with an average IQ of 135, with basically everyone no life working 70 hour weeks.

###Personal experience:

- So far in China I dated 2 girls working from PDD. One worked in HR and one worked in product. They were horribly unattractive. Why? They dunno how to use makeup, they dunno how to dress. They only know how to work. The HR girl especially, told me just how many interviews they‚Äôre doing. They‚Äôre growing FAST. Their work pace is literally incomprehensible for clueless westerners. I‚Äôd wager most US tech workers would probably have a mental breakdown if they work 1 month at PDD, because they simply can‚Äôt handle its pace and the stress.
- After moving back to china, I first started buying shit off jd.com and taobao because I haven‚Äôt heard of PDD. Then one day I started using PDD, and from that day onwards, 80% of my online purchases are from PDD. It‚Äôs simply the best shopping app in China for most items. That‚Äôs all you need to know.

The biggest counter-argument is‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a chinese company! They‚Äôre cooking the books‚Äù

- Just because 1 chinese company cooked the books, doesn‚Äôt mean every chinese company is cooking the books, dumbass.
- Chinese companies live in fear of being delisted due to the bad reputation that chinese companies have. Do you really think they‚Äôre dumb enough to cook the books when they got a target on their back? If you got a target pointed at your back, you play it safe, dumbass.
- That 1 chinese company known for cooking its books? Well, if you bought its stock at the bottom, you would have 15x‚Äôed your money, dumbass

PDD is a long term hold for me, although I might consider selling if it hits ~$200 USD (2x my book value) in a short timeframe and look at other options.

###This is a sure thing.

###Trust me on this one.

P.S. Most of you dumbasses are too dumb to realize that China‚Äôs stock market today is like US‚Äôs stock market in the 70s. Buffett‚Äôs success cannot be replicated today in the US market, but it can be replicated in the chinese market. There are so many undervalued stocks in the Chinese stock market today due to the intense fear investors have for the Chinese stock market, both from domestic chinese investors and international. There are so many opportunities in the chinese stock market today, but most of you watch too much western propaganda and don‚Äôt have enough brain cells to think anything else except ‚ÄúCHINA BAD‚Äù, ‚ÄúCANT TRUST NO CHINESE COMPANY‚Äù, ‚ÄúTHEY BE COOKING THE BOOKS AND SHIT YO‚Äù, ‚ÄúCHINESE BE COMMUNIST AND SHIT BRO LOL‚Äù"
Roku‚Äôs real value is in the data.,"I want you to ask yourself a question:

How valuable are the things we pay attention to? 

**Half** of American households have a Roku device.

Roku is the leading streaming TV distributor in the U.S., reaching nearly 120 million people.**Roku's audience is larger than the subscribers of the six largest traditional pay-TV providers combined.** It is the #1 smart TV streaming OS in the US, Canada and Mexico.

Source: https://developer.roku.com/docs/features/features-overview.md

As of the third quarter of 2024, Roku has 85.5 million active accounts worldwide, which is the company's highest ever, a 12.8% increase from Q3 2023.

Streaming time per active user: 246.8 minutes per day in Q3 2024, a 5.8% increase from Q3 2023

As part of Roku‚Äôs privacy policy, they collect:

‚ÄúInformation about your activities, like the channels you install or access (including usage statistics such as what channels you access, the time you access them, and how long you spend viewing them), and information about the videos and other content you select and stream within these streaming services. If you use the Roku Media Player to view your video or photo files or listen to your music files, Roku will collect data about the files viewed within the Roku Media Player, such as codecs, and other metadata of the local files you play.‚Äù

https://docs.roku.com/published/userprivacypolicy/en/us

Why do you think they practically give away their streaming sticks? The money isn‚Äôt in their devices, it‚Äôs in the data they collect on you. 

Google‚Äôs in a similar business. They have 4.97 billion users, and their market cap is 2.14 Trillion. The valuation is 428x the amount of users.

If we applied the same multiples, that means $ROKU is worth around a 37 Billion dollar market cap, putting $ROKU at $250 a share. 

I‚Äôd venture to say it‚Äôs more around $750 a share, given the majority of Roku‚Äôs users are in the US.

Let‚Äôs see what this holds.

Moderna is about to break out,"Context: An as yet, unidentified virus with respiratory symptoms is circulating in the South West DR Congo region of Kwango. It has affected at least 3 different towns, with 179 people now dead, from over 300 people infected. First cases were recorded in mid-November, with cases likely stretching back to late October. Things are moving quickly. Kinshasa with 17 million people, sits 3.5 hours drive from Kwango.

What could it be? 
Kwango was identified in a 2020 research paper as an area at-risk of a potential zoonotic spillover event (see picture). The study found that bats in the area were infected with coronaviruses with high genetic similarity to existing human coronaviruses. Notably, while recent experience has exemplified the threat of coronaviruses from Asian bat populations, several coronaviruses that now constitute common colds, likely originated in ancestral African bat populations.

What could we expect in coming days: The last time a substantive pandemic risk hit the market (bird flu), Moderna‚Äôs stock rose 40% in a short period of time (peaking at $166). This was despite there being no evidence of human-to-human transmission, H5N1 vaccines already available commercially from competing firms, and effective flu antivirals. Given this is unlikely to be a flu virus, Moderna will have a much more competitive edge, and we could expect to see a much stronger share price result.

Risk:

If this doesn‚Äôt turn out to be a pandemic risk, the downside risk is low. The news of this event only reached western media yesterday, and hasn‚Äôt materially affected prices yet. At the current price you are getting in on the ground floor. Additionally, RFK‚Äôs nomination has driven market sentiment of Moderna‚Äôs stock to just above cash, which mitigates the downside risk of negative trial readouts in coming weeks.

MDA Space $MDALF is profitable and will possibly be trading in the US Stock market soon,"This great Canadian Space sector company (¬†[https://mda.space](https://mda.space)¬†) has a beautiful chart showing their growth and is profitable. They have market cap of 3.2 Billion. What do they do?

MDA Space is a technology and services company that¬†provides advanced solutions to the global space industry:

* **Geointelligence**:¬†Uses satellite data and imagery for climate change monitoring, national security, and global commerce
* **Robotics & Space Operations**:¬†Provides autonomous robotics and vision sensors for space exploration
* **Satellite Systems**:¬†Provides spacecraft and systems for space-based services, including broadband internet connectivity¬†

MDA Space has a history of firsts and over 450 missions.¬†They have been providing operational readiness support for the International Space Station's (ISS) Mobile Servicing System since 2001. They are also known for delivering large-scale robotic systems, such as Canadarm2.

And this excerpt from a post by user manolo44 sure is bullish:

""Their earnings report was stellar: growth of 38% yoy, it is actually¬†**PROFITABLE**¬†\- none of the other space companies are profitable - profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, up 30% YoY, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, net income up 60% yoy, and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.8x (so zero risk of dilution). However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be¬†**definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M**¬†‚Äì of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog ‚Äì a**n additional $450M is going to be added**¬†upon finalization and t**his will happen by year‚Äôs end.**¬†They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog.

 MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec,¬†**capable of producing two satellites per day**¬†starting in late 2025.""

And then I heard this:

MDA Space, which is a sleeping giant merely because it trades in the Toronto Stock Exchange rather than US, is exploring listing in the US, according to comments by its CEO;

‚ÄúManagement suggested that it continues to explore a potential dual stock listing in the U.S.""

Now I am not sure how a dual listing will effect my 500 MDALF shares but if I had to guess I would say it will be a good thing.

There have been posts on Reddit about how bad of a company they are to their employees, but just like Yelp you usually only hear about the bad apples, not the good ones, so I take that with a grain of salt.

"
$CVNA - Carvana and its close relationship with DriveTime,"Too many weird things happening with this company and industry, so I might break this DD into parts.

*Not financial advice. Borderline fiction. Don't take what is written here for granted.*

TL;DR: Carvana has ""*not at arm's length arrangements*"" with DriveTime and this could be boosting their metrics. Meanwhile, Carvana's controlling shareholder and DriveTime's owner, Ernie Garcia II, has sold $1.4 billion in shares over the last few months.

# Numbers:

* Market cap of $53 Billion
* P/E ratio: 31,000x (yup, thousands)
* D/E ratio: 10x ($6.2B debt for just $600M equity)
* Founded: 2012 (as a spinoff of DriveTime)
* Employees: 13.700
* CEO: Ernie Garcia III (son of Ernie Garcia II, owner of DriveTime, and controlling shareholder of Carvana) ([TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-CVNA/financials-overview/))
* Insider Trading: +$1.6bi on stock sold in L12M, including:
   * Ernie Garcia II: \~$1.4 billion since April
   * Mark Jenkins (CFO): +$72 million and plans to sell more ([YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carvana-ceo-father-sees-1-163234402.html), [SecForm](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1690820.htm))
* \~9 million shares issued in Q2, bringing $347 million as cash and further diluting shareholder's equity. ([Q2 QR](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q2-2024.pdf))
* *""Record Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.7%, a new all-time best for public automotive retailers""* is a highlight of their Q3 results. ([CVNA Q3 2024](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-earning-release-q3-2024.pdf)).

# Hypothesis

Given that Ernie Garcia II owns DriveTime, Bridgecrest, and SilverRock and remains Carvana's controlling shareholder, Carvana could have been given beneficial contract terms that improved its metrics and, consequently, its market price.

Take a look at these paragraphs from their [2023 Annual Report (page 20)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082024000093/cvna-20231231.htm):

>""We were incubated by and may benefit from our relationship and a series of **arrangements with DriveTime not always negotiated at arm‚Äôs length**, as DriveTime is controlled by our controlling shareholder who is also the father of our chief executive officer. (...)

>DriveTime built certain of our inspection and reconditioning centers (""IRCs"") in Georgia, New Jersey, and Texas and is now our landlord at some such sites. Verde Investments, Inc. (""Verde""), an affiliate of DriveTime, formerly leased to us our Arizona IRC and sold it to us in 2020. We have also historically leased certain of our hubs from DriveTime. (...)

>Consequently, certain of **our historical costs and expansion activities may not accurately reflect our future costs and expansion** to the extent that DriveTime no longer provides us with such services or refuses to continue doing so at currently contracted-for prices.""

>""We continue to periodically engage DriveTime, its affiliates, and other entities controlled by our controlling shareholder to provide us with certain services, including the administration of certain VSCs and other related products sold to our customers. (...)

>Additionally, **DriveTime has in the past and may in the future purchase or sell certain vehicles or automotive finance receivables from or to us**. However, there can be no assurance that they will do so on the same or similar terms, or at all. As a result, our historical results may not be reflected in our future results.

>Before and after we sell automotive finance receivables originated by us, **DriveTime performs ongoing servicing and collections**. If DriveTime is unwilling to enter into servicing arrangements for our future automotive finance receivable transactions on terms or at prices consistent with their historical prices or at all, our revenues derived from the sale of those receivables may decline as a result. (...)""

By **""not always negotiated at arm‚Äôs length""**, it implies they might be receiving favorable benefits in terms of assets, revenue, and expenses. This raises the possibility that their reports may not fairly represent their future costs and expansion, as some aspects could be currently ""hidden"" under the financial and operational support from DriveTime.

According to their Q3 2024 reporting, \~15% of their L9M operating income comes from related parties. ([Q3 Report](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q3-2024.pdf))

# ELI5:

1. Carvana could be unintentionally overstating revenues and understating future expenses through its favorable agreements with DriveTime;
2. Carvana share price increases based on its *""all-time best""* metrics;
3. Ernie Garcia II - Carvana's controlling shareholder and DriveTime's owner - sells $1.4 billion in stock;
4. At some point, DriveTime and its affiliates may change or dismiss the arrangements, and Carvana's actual revenue, capex, and opex numbers would show up.

# ""Other Gross Profit Per Unit - GPU""

Carvana mentioned their ""Total gross profit per unit (""GPU"") was $7,427."" on their [Q3 2024 report](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q3-2024.pdf).

They arrive at this figure by adding together ""Retail GPU"", ""Wholesale GPU"", and ""Other GPU"". I find this calculation quite suspicious tbh but I want to focus on **""Other GPU""** instead, which was $3,000. 

Going back to the [2023 Annual Report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082024000093/cvna-20231231.htm):

>""Other sales and revenues, which primarily includes gains on the sales of finance receivables we originate and sales commissions on ancillary products such as VSCs, GAP waiver coverage, and auto insurance, totaled $753 million and $741 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (...) **Other sales and revenues are 100% gross margin products for which gross profit equals revenue**."" (...)

>""We generate other sales and revenues primarily through the sales of loans we originate and sell in securitization transactions or to financing partners, reported net of a reserve for expected repurchases, commissions we receive on VSCs, sales of GAP waiver coverage, and commissions and Root Warrants we receive on sales of auto insurance"" (...)

>""In 2016, we entered into a master dealer agreement with DriveTime, pursuant to which **we receive a commission for selling VSCs that DriveTime administers**. The commission revenue we recognize on VSCs depends on the number of retail units we sell, the conversion rate of VSCs on these sales, commission rates we receive, VSC early cancellation frequency and product features. The GAP waiver coverage revenue we recognize depends on the number of retail units we sell, the number of customers that choose to finance their purchases with us, the frequency of GAP waiver coverage early cancellation, and the conversion rate of GAP waiver coverage on those sales."" (...)

>""**DriveTime purchases wholesale vehicles from, and sells wholesale vehicles to, both the Company and unrelated third parties** through both competitive online auctions that are managed by unrelated third parties and the Company's wholesale marketplace platform. Additionally, beginning in September 2023, **the Company provided DriveTime with reconditioning services through its wholesale marketplace platform. The Company recognized $19 million, $32 million, and $54 million of wholesale sales and revenues from DriveTime** during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.""

Carvana engages in transactions with DriveTime **'not always at arm‚Äôs length,'** and DriveTime accounts for a relevant portion of Carvana's revenue and gross profit. This can be a problem.

Consider also a **hypothetical** scenario:

Imagine a vehicle with a market price of $10,000. Carvana buys it from a customer for $10,000 and then sells it to DriveTime for $11,000. DriveTime reconditions the vehicle and sells it back to Carvana at a wholesale price of $8,000. Carvana then sells it to a customer for $10,500.

* Carvana gross profit: $3,500
* DriveTime gross profit: -$3,000 (excl. costs)

This wouldn't be sustainable unless: 1. you own and control both companies, 2. one of them is publicly traded and sensitive to profitability metrics, and 3. you have the ability to sell shares whenever needed.

Please I'm not suggesting this happens at Carvana, but given their *not always at arm's length arrangements* and the lack of detailed data, this scenario remains a possibility. We rely on the work of their auditors to ensure that this is not the case.

# How to validate that hypothesis?

We would need to investigate the benefits Carvana receives, verify any discrepancies from reality, consider internal transactions, and calculate how these might affect the GPU and other metrics. Unfortunately, SEC reports don't offer enough info for that.

Based on their [2024 Proxy Meeting document](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/proxy-statement-2024.pdf), these are the agreements between Carvana and DriveTeam entities and how Carvana has recognized revenue and expenses (summarized via GPT):

# SG&A Expenses

On a side note, I found it impressive how they've managed to grow retail units sold and expand market hubs without increasing their SG&A expenses over the quarters.

https://preview.redd.it/tiyxx6fztw4e1.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbb011b2e54031366e11afd3614f45dd19773ff6

https://preview.redd.it/ey0l1q60uw4e1.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8760c18263acd55275c4ead7c95139c9c31ce21

They expanded from \~120,000 retail and wholesale vehicles sold in Q3 2023 to +160,000 within 12 months, keeping their market occupancy and logistics costs flat. This should be featured as a case study by Harvard Business Review.

Quick Note: Under ""definitional differences to consider"" on [this document from Q4 2023](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q4-2023.pdf), ""Limited Warranty Expenses"" and ""Outbound Logistics Expenses"" are included in SG&A expense rather than COGS. Given that, I'd have expected SG&A to increase as a result of selling +35% more vehicles.

# What are other people saying?

1. **Grant Thornton** highlighted the financial receivables part as a ""critical audit matter"" ([2023 Annual Report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082024000093/cvna-20231231.htm)).
2. **Kellisdale Capital** sent a letter to the SEC in February requesting an investigation into these accounting practices ([Source](https://www.kerrisdalecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CVNA-Auditor-Letter.pdf)).
3. Many people here on Reddit raised similar questions.

Let me know if I've missed any relevant details or made mistakes. I might post the second part soon, which will cover how their main gross profit depends on low interest rates, along with an overview of their cash flow.

Disclosure: I own puts expiring between March 2025 and early 2026. I was struck by the fact that the company depends heavily on DriveTime to operate, has less-than-ideal corporate governance, extreme high debt, and the market still values it at $53 billion."
$ASO: Strong Earnings Potential,"Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO) is a strong player in the sporting goods and outdoor recreation market, but it's flying under the radar heading into the holiday season. The company has a solid track record of profitability, strong revenue growth, and a valuation that looks too low to ignore. 

# Financial Highlights

* **12 mo Revenue**: $6.11B
* **Net Income**: $487.2M
* **12 mo EPS**: $6.45 pretty solid for a retailer in this space
* **Valuation**: P/E ratio is 7.44. For comparison, Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods is 14.97 and they sell the same stuff
* **FCF**: $218M up from $167M last quarter

# Why ASO Stands Out

1. Academy opened 16 new stores in 2024 with 1/3 of those in Q4 alone. Goal by 2027 is to open between 160-180 new stores.
2. Partnering with DoorDash for same day delivery so you can get your Wendy's frosty and a new baseball glove in the same order.
3. Academy is known more for its winter and spring sports. Think hunting, fishing, baseball, basketball and those seasons are here and around the corner. And yes they carry all the same items that Dick's does often for more of a deal (Yeti, Nike, Carhartt, Shimano, Brooks, Rawlings, UnderAmour, etc).
4. ASO consistently generates strong earnings, but the market hasn‚Äôt caught up yet imo. The P/E ratio is significantly lower than the industry average, making it a potential value play.
5. The **12/10 earnings report** could provide the boost this stock needs, especially if they beat expectations or provide strong holiday guidance. Plus, the holiday season itself is a crucial time for ASO, and strong Q4 sales could drive further upside. 
6. Analysts are on board with an average price target of $63.40. That‚Äôs about a 30% upside from where it‚Äôs trading now, suggesting there‚Äôs room to grow with upper end being $85.
7. Currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, maybe signaling some hesitation in the market but if it breaks through those levels after earnings, it might attract more buyers.
8. At 62.99 RSI, it‚Äôs not quite overbought but heading in that direction - another sign that buyers are starting to show some interest.

**TLDR**

Academy Sports is a profitable, undervalued company with a big quarter ahead into the holiday/ spring sports season.

**Position (im poor for now)**: 20 1/17 $70c"
ZIM at a discount price,"ZIM Integrated Shipping Services had a strong Q3 earnings release in November beating the expectations. They raised their 2024 full year guidance of 300M and it's very likely they will give another good dividend for the upcoming quarter.

After the earnings release on Nov 20 the price shoot up to $30 and came back down in the oversold territory of $19, the P/E of the company is fairly low right now.

One of the reasons about that recent drop in price is because it's a dividend stock and they will pay a juicy $3.65 per share on Dec 9 which represents 16.5% on the last day (Nov 29) before trading ex-dividend (Dec 2).

The stock is currently consolidating and staying in the range of $18 to $21 until the dividend is received (Dec 9) and starting next week I'm expexting to stock price to move back up again.

The company added 42 new ships in the past 3 years and they are expecting 4 more ships by the end of 2024. More ships shoud bring more revenues if no outside factors disturb their activities and the container price stays in the same range.

That's my quick thesis on this stock and if you dig deeper I think you should feel comfortable in putting money on this play. Source as always : Trust me bro!

TL:DR ... I expect ZIM to go up in the range of $24.5 / $26.5 within the next 2 months. You can play safe and buy shares of try calls for Feb 21 or later.

Positions 120k :
5500 shares @ $22.12 (pre-dividend)
55CC Dec 6 strike $21.16
Waiting for my dividend on Dec 9 5500 x $3.65 = 20k

This is not financial advice I'm just another regard who is up 300% this year and hoping for more. Cheers!"
Nebius Group (NBIS) your new AI baby that's set to double or triple,"This company used to be Yandex (the Google of Russia) but with Ukraine sanctions it was temporarily delisted before appealing to Nasdaq and agreeing to sever all ties with Russia in order to be relisted. They're Netherlands-based now, making their business *very* cool and *very* legal. Market cap is currently 6.55 billion and Yandex previously reached a valuation of 31 billion back in 2021--you do the math (with the shitty little calculator you keep on your desk). Does 2+2 still equal 4? Then it's a buy, brother. **BROTHER**.

And on Monday it was announced that NVDA and a few others dumped $700 million into the company:

>09:03 AM EST, 12/02/2024 (MT Newswires) -- Nebius Group (NBIS) announced Monday a $700 million private placement financing with participation from Accel, NVIDIA, and Orbis Investments.

>The company said the funds will support the company's global expansion of full-stack AI infrastructure, including large-scale GPU clusters, cloud platforms, and AI development tools.

>The financing involves issuing 33.33 million Class A shares at $21 each, a 3% premium to the recent average trading price.

>Proceeds will bolster Nebius' AI-native infrastructure, such as its Nebius AI Studio and build-to-suit data centers.

>Accel Partner Matt Weigand has been granted board observer rights and will be nominated as a director in 2025.

>Following strong trading activity since October, Nebius has canceled plans to repurchase its Class A shares.

I don't know about you guys, but I trust NVDA because Jensen once signed a woman's boobs and that's what I look for in a CEO.

Your Most Expensive RDDT Scroll: A Story From 2026,"**Charles Dickens here (tl;dr at the end):** *Thanksgiving 2026. Your electric car just auto-parked (still no flying cars, thanks Elon). Walking in, you hear uncle Dave's voice over the turkey: ""This readit thing is amazing! Found out how to fix my garage door on the DIY subbit last week. Bought some shares at $300 when my buddy at Fidelity wouldn't shut up about it. Hey, weren't you always on this reddit site?""*

The same RDDT that's now everyone's go-to for actually useful answers instead of SEO garbage that used to trend at the top of search results. The site you're still checking 47 times a day.

# Let's Rewind to 2024 When You (Maybe) Missed It

Here are the numbers staring you in the face right now:

* 90% margins (better than Google, thanks to text-based content and mods)
* 68% revenue growth year over year
* 97.2M daily users growing 47% annually
* Data licensing up 547% (turns out our shitposting has value)
* Wall Street quietly loading up (+122% institutional ownership change)

[‚≠ê Former CEO Yishan casually dropped the blueprint 3 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gomnhh/comment/lwnsl9e/): *""Reddit is one of the largest actually-useful-content sites on the internet.

While other platforms chased AI chatbots, Reddit doubled down on being the place for real human knowledge - **and they are now getting paid for this by -all- ML/AI providers to train their models in an ongoing way.** Why should it stop? Imagine if Google stopped indexing the web in 2021, how useful would it be?

# Congratulations, You Had Alpha and (Maybe) Acted Like a Beta

Alpha, aka you can beat the market due to ""not yet fully priced in"". For once in your life, you actually had insider information and a headstart. You've been using this platform daily for years, watching it grow, survive blackouts and rebellions, seeing the engagement firsthand. Everyone said at one point ""that is enough, I'm leaving"", and yet here we are.

Look at the institutional ownership story (based on Finviz data)

* Pinterest: 77%
* Snap: 51%
* Reddit: 39%, and growing crazy (+122% increase, mostly since the Q3 number revelation)

Translation: Those Chad analysts who just ""discovered"" Reddit still have % of buying to do just to match other social platforms. The same guys writing [$200 price targets (and $300 bull cases)](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/reddit-upgraded-overweight-equal-weight-morgan-stanley) are probably reading this post right now for their next investment thesis, updating their PowerPoints about ""untapped market potential"" and ""engagement metrics"" that you've been seeing firsthand for years.

They're figuring out that:

1. The platform has better margins than Google (90%) - thanks to mostly text-based content
2. Growing faster than Pinterest or Snap ever did - thanks to Google-vouch and ML localization
3. With the latest AI-craze, their non-stop, text-base, perfectly crawlable human content can be heavily licensed ($)

* Actually profitable
* Better margins than both combined
* Still only using 1/3 to 1/2 of potential ad space compred to others
* Machine learning translation rolling out to 30+ countries (tests in France showed +50% growth)
* The only major platform still growing users at 47% YoY
* See chart below: **relative** Google Trend (per platform) shows RDDT is more trending than ever before

Teladoc Health (TDOC): Why It‚Äôs Poised for a Comeback,"#

Hello fellow degenerates,

Let‚Äôs talk about Teladoc (TDOC). If you‚Äôve been following, you know it‚Äôs been through the fire and the flames. Once a darling of the telehealth boom, it‚Äôs now more like the kid who got benched after fucking up the big game. But I believe the tide is about to turn. Here‚Äôs my DD on why Teladoc might just be gearing up for a glorious comeback.&#x20;

---

## 1. **Current Stock Snapshot: The Lay of the Land**

Teladoc‚Äôs stock has seen better days, but as of now:

- **Stock Price:** \$10.95 (down slightly today).
- **52-Week Range:** From scraping the barrel at \$9.50 to peaking around \$30.
- **Market Cap:** Roughly \$1.8 billion.

This might look like a crash and burn to some, but I see opportunity at a discount.

---

## 2. **Leadership Overhaul: A Fresh Start**

In June 2024, Teladoc made a bold move by appointing **Chuck Divita** as CEO. For context, Divita‚Äôs background includes:

- Leadership roles in companies like **Humana**, where he focused on growth and operational efficiency.
- A track record of successfully restructuring struggling business units.

Divita‚Äôs focus on cost-cutting and streamlining operations has already started to show results in the company‚Äôs latest reporting and the best is yet to come.

---

## 3. **Financial Performance: Clearing the Decks**

Let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room: Teladoc‚Äôs financials. Here‚Äôs what we know from Q2 2024:

- **Goodwill Impairment:** They took a \$790 million write-down on BetterHelp, their mental health arm, which has a dogshit reputation, especially after their data privacy scandal. Believe it or not, people don‚Äôt want their deepest secrets and personal data sold to third parties. Whodathunkit?
- **Net Loss:** \$838 million (yikes, but let‚Äôs look closer).
- **Revenue:** \$650 million (up 5% YOY).

### Why This Isn‚Äôt All Bad News:

- The goodwill impairment is an accounting adjustment. It‚Äôs painful now, but it clears the books for future growth.
- BetterHelp‚Äôs revenue decline is a reflection of tightened marketing spend, which aligns with the new CEO‚Äôs cost-cutting strategy.
- TDOC has had a steady upward trend in revenue growth YOY. A good sign of internal management.

---

## 4. **Market Position: Still a Leader**

Teladoc remains a dominant player in telehealth, with:

- 80+ million members.
- Partnerships with major insurers like UnitedHealthcare and CVS Health.
- A robust tech platform that integrates telehealth, mental health, and chronic condition management.

### Competitors:

Teladoc‚Äôs main rivals are Amwell and MDLIVE, but neither has the same level of services, and also Amwell is dogshit. Teladoc‚Äôs ecosystem approach makes it stand out, especially as big employers and insurers need seamless integrated solutions.

---

## 5. **Industry Outlook: Telehealth Is Here to Stay**

The pandemic normalized virtual care, but the trend isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Key stats:

- **Market Growth:** The global telehealth market is projected to reach \$560 billion by 2030 (CAGR of 24%).
- **Adoption Rates:** 40% of patients now prefer telehealth for routine care.
- **Regulatory Tailwinds:** The U.S. government has extended telehealth reimbursement policies through 2025.

Teladoc is uniquely positioned to capture this growth, thanks to its first-mover advantage and established brand.

---

## 6. **Valuation: A Bargain Basement Buy?**

At its current price, Teladoc trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.5x. For comparison:

- **Amwell:** 2.3x P/S.
- **Healthcare Sector Average:** 4.0x P/S.

This signals Teladoc is significantly undervalued relative to peers, especially given its revenue growth.

---

## 7. **Catalysts: What Could Drive a Comeback?**

- **Profitability Goals:** Teladoc aims to achieve positive EBITDA by mid-2025.
- **Product Expansion:** Launching AI-powered tools for personalized care.
- **Potential Acquisition Target:** At its current valuation, TDOC could attract interest from larger healthcare players.

---

## 8. **Risks: No Rose-Colored Glasses**

- **Competition:**¬†Amazon is in this space. Relentless as fuck as always.
- **Marketing Spend:** Scaling back on ads could slow growth in the short term but is smart for a branding reboot.
- **Macroeconomic Factors:** Higher interest rates make growth companies less attractive to some investors.

---

## 9. **Conclusion: Why I‚Äôm Bullish**

Teladoc is a classic turnaround story. Yes, it‚Äôs been beaten down, but the fundamentals‚Äîleadership changes, cost-cutting, and a growing market‚Äîsuggest a brighter future. At its current valuation, the risk-reward ratio looks attractive.

Do I want to be convinced otherwise? Fucking no so leave me alone bc I‚Äôm sensitive.

---

### TL;DR

- New leadership and strategic reset.
- Strong market position in a growing industry.
- Valuation suggests upside potential.
- Risks exist, but the reward looks worth it.

*Disclaimer: I‚Äôm just a rando on the internet sharing opinions, this is not financial advice, I just like the stock.*

"
SMCI - value or trap?,"I have seen many post about SMCI and highlighting its potential undervalued qualities. Many see it *growing* to $160 a share, but in a crowd of bulls I will be one of the bears on the company. 

Whenever one wants to get a feel for what the priorities of a company are one should look no further than how executives are rewarded. CEO Charles Liang went from a salary + options package prior to 2021 to a $1.00 salary & pure options/RSU package in March of 2021 when the **2021 CEO Performance Package** was passed. Interesting timing given the boom in the AI markets. Mr. Liang cannot have his salary or other cash  comp adjusted until June 30th, 2026.

One of the KPI's was based around none other than share price appreciation. The package was awarded and set at a share price of $34.08 and the goals were broken into five tranches with the highest being $120 a share and all this needed to be hit by September 30th, 2026. This would have been a CAGR of 25% over ~5.5 years but lucky for SMCI shareholders this was achieved in ~2.2 years for a 75% CAGR. 

In November 2023 the compensation package was adjusted with the approval of the **2023 CEO Compensation Package** where SMCI was again lucky enough to achieve almost all goals on share price appreciation on these new tranches too. 

Their CFO had no KPI's around the company's health. Nothing regarding leverage ratios, operating income, cash flow generation, but three KPI's that were 1) share price appreciation (2X weighted), long-term investor increase (2X weighted), and an individual performance measured by Mr. Liang. The CFO being rewarded heavily on share price appreciation and attractive investing should be a red flag. And while the CFO achieved these goals in such a short time, he has now been rewarded with losing his job. One must ask why?

Another target is around revenue growth and while any company should be focused on revenue, the above KPI's highlight a culture that is focused on driving share price appreciation before all else. There is an active whistleblower lawsuit stating SMCI improperly recognized revenue and just today that same whistleblower doubled down on such claims. 

December 5th, 2023 SMCI made a public offering of 2,415,805 shares, then they went and issued convertible notes in February 2024, then on March 22nd, 2024 they went and issued another round of equity for 2,000,000 shares. All of this equity at a time when executives are rewarded for share price gains.

The Ablecom/Compuware relationship has been called out and I think it should have more attention. There is a lot of PO movement between these companies that are all owned by relatives. These two companies also handle design work, tool builds, and various other things; do we know where all the debt lies and perhaps CAPEX is understated as it's absorbed elsewhere? Impossible to say either way given we can't get public financials for these other organizations. No comment from SMCI leaves investors left to speculate. 

Now we get to the recent news of EY resigning. I have seen some estimates that EY was walking from multiple million dollar deal in being the auditor for SMCI, what did they see? Given the trouble EY has had over the past few years with a failed split and SEC fines, walking away from a potential AI darling account seems very difficult to understand. In the 8-K statement filed by SMCI, EY was quoted as ***""we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee‚Äôs representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.‚Äù***, which is no light statement. Yet, an internal investigation by SMCI finds nothing that aligned with what EY found? No discrepancy at all? This investigation by SMCI was led by someone who is now a board member, but of course Mr. Market rallies on the news of ""no fault"" but the pieces do not fit.

The recent cancellations of two bank facilities should also raise red flags. It is clear if you read the terms that SMCI was in violation of debt covenants and would have been in default, but these terminations now constrict liquidity. SMCI has stated they will possibly need these lending facilities to fund inventory as they see growth, but because of these filings delays and auditor resignations they cancelled them. I am not seeing many talk about the future growth constraints from this move. It also highlights there may be more here because why not work with the banks? Unless of course you have no intention of filing your 10-K/Q anytime soon or there is true risks on what BDO finds. 

While the above may indeed be nothing, I am having a hard time reading the recent events as bullish. While a self audit is good show and will likely prevent a delisting, the delayed 10-K/Q gives investors no insight into where the company stands. It is possible BDO will begin their audit and find gaps the same as EY. The equity offerings at a time when executives are rewarded for share price appreciation also is a red flag from an investor POV as your dilution is funding direct reward. The MOAT for SMCI is not as strong as many state and the margins are not either. 

While this may be value in many investors eyes, there is some big risks here that I see ignored because stoinks only go up.

**Edit:** corrected the second sentence from ""many see it return"" to ""many see it growing"" which is what I meant.
**Edit 2**: this isn't investment advice and one should invest after doing their **OWN** DD. I am only presenting a bear case that is on what I can find via public filings with the SEC. Again, do your own DD and don't invest based on anything anyone writes on social media."
$CROX 2025 undervalued play ,"local stores are consistently busy, and the brand is a favorite, which is a positive sign. However, I have concerns about whether the brand can maintain its popularity, especially if trends shift or kids gravitate toward something new. Competition from cheaper alternatives and the long lifespan of Crocs for adults, which may reduce repeat purchases, could pose challenges over time.


	1.	Low Valuation Multiples: Crocs is currently trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 8.06, significantly lower than the average P/E ratio in the consumer discretionary sector. Additionally, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.62 and price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) ratio of 6.90 suggest the stock is priced attractively relative to its revenue and cash flow generation.

	2.	Strong Margins and Cash Flow: The company boasts healthy margins, with gross margins at 58.15% and an operating margin of 26.16%. Its free cash flow has grown steadily, reaching $940 million in the trailing twelve months, with a free cash flow yield of 14.49%

	3.	Revenue Growth and Market Position: Crocs has shown consistent revenue growth, with a 3.17% year-over-year increase for 2024. It also maintains a strong position in the casual footwear market, bolstered by a popular product lineup and strategic acquisitions.

	4.	Debt Management: While its debt-to-equity ratio is on the higher side at 1.03, it has significantly reduced its leverage compared to previous years, improving its overall financial health.

The market is not fully appreciating its profitability, brand strength, and ability to generate cash flow. 

Disclosures I have x5 2/21/25 $125 calls "
GTLB - DD,"Okay y‚Äôall this is my first time doing one of these, so please be patient.

People have asked me about this trade for a while now, so here are my thoughts.

I give this a buy rating for the earnings call.

Here is why.

The daily, weekly, and monthly charts are showing undervalued with positive upside as indicated by the Bollinger bands.


The MACD is indicating a buy crossover at the end of a long red period.

Implied volatility seems to say there will be a +-13.5% move.

Previous earnings look good, not too worried about anything in the news.

Spy is red today and is generally pulling other stocks, down, but GTLB is pushing back.

My expectation is that we buy now, hold through earnings because this is the perfect setup for that discount pricing.

SPY recovers in a day or two and trends up giving the market a boost. When earnings come, it will catapult. The charts say it is going up, spy will boost that. If it goes down, spy will slow it a little, but I would expect a 3m period of holding to get out at the current price if it drops by 13%.

So, there we have it, a perfect setup, with market boosting, and earnings catalyst ready to push up.

My anticipated price target is $71.

Thoughts?"
$AUTL - Insanely Undervalued Cancer Treatment,"Hey, I don't know why more people aren't talking about this, so here I go doing my best to articulate how excited I am for this stock.

# What the hell is it?

Autolus Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in CAR-T cell therapies aimed at treating various cancers. Their flagship product, Aucatzyl (obecabtagene autoleucel), targets relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL).

# Recent Developments

* **FDA Approval:** On November 8, 2024, the FDA approved Aucatzyl for adult patients with r/r B-ALL, marking a significant milestone for the company. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/autolus-therapeutics-reports-third-quarter-120000687.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Clinical Data Publication:** The New England Journal of Medicine published data from the pivotal Phase 1b/2 FELIX study of Aucatzyl, reporting a 76.6% overall response rate with a low incidence of severe immune-related toxicities. Needless to say, this is a huge deal.

# Financial Health

As of Q3 September 30, 2024, Autolus reported:

* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** $657.1 million, up from $239.6 million as of December 31, 2023. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/autolus-therapeutics-reports-third-quarter-120000687.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Total Operating Expenses:** $67.9 million for Q3 2024, compared to $42.9 million for the same period in 2023.
* **Net Loss:** $82.1 million for Q3 2024, up from $45.8 million in Q3 2023.

The company estimates that its current cash reserves are sufficient to support the full launch and commercialization of Aucatzyl in r/r adult B-ALL, as well as advance its pipeline development plans.

# Technical Analysis

(Take this part with a grain of salt, because I'm 100% regurgitating the information I found.) The stock is trading above its short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating a potential bullish trend.

* **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 14-day RSI is at 37.34%, suggesting the stock is approaching oversold territory.
* **Stochastic Oscillator:** 14-day value at 31.91%, also indicating potential oversold conditions.
* **MACD:** The MACD line is below the signal line, a bearish indicator suggesting downward momentum.
* **Support and Resistance Levels:**
   * **Support:** $2.80
   * **Resistance:** $3.50

Breaking above the $3.50 resistance could signal a bullish reversal, while dropping below the $2.80 support may lead to further declines.

# Bull Case

* **Regulatory Milestone:** FDA approval of Aucatzyl positions Autolus as a key player in the CAR-T therapy market.
* **Strong Clinical Data:** High response rates with low toxicity enhance the therapy's market potential.
* **Solid Cash Position:** With over $657 million in cash, the company is well-funded for commercialization and pipeline development.
* **Analyst Optimism:** Analysts have set **an average price target of $10.20**, suggesting significant upside potential. ([Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/autl/forecast/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# Bear Case

* **Market Competition:** The CAR-T therapy space is competitive, with established players like Novartis and Gilead.
* **Financial Losses:** Increasing net losses may raise concerns about long-term profitability.
* **Execution Risks:** Challenges in manufacturing, distribution, and market adoption could impact commercial success.

# Conclusion

Autolus Therapeutics has achieved significant milestones with the FDA approval of Aucatzyl and promising clinical data. While the stock has experienced recent volatility, sure, the long-term outlook appears positive, especially considering the potential market impact of their CAR-T therapies. Therefore, especially considering that analysts believe this is either a strong buy or simply undervalued, this is a great play for the next 12 months. That being said, you do you, and manage your own risks. **Biotech is notoriously high risk, high reward, so keep that in mind.**

$PL - Earth Data to Become Increasingly Valuable Under Trump Administration,"Alright, cat has gotten out of the bag while I have been writing this and Planet Labs is no longer a secret. This analysis is not written by ChatGPT, hopefully not nauseatingly sales-y, and has no regarded emojis or over the top use of ‚ÄúTo the Moon‚Äù. No frills, just my take on where I think there is deep value.

**Overview:**  
Earth observation data as a business has long struggled to be profitable. It requires significant CAPEX, is high risk (strapping a cam to a rocket essentially), and the R+D on a lot of the imaging can be pretty exorbitant. The main leader in the space, Planet Labs, went public in the SPAC boom. As a whole, they‚Äôve underperformed the promises they presented in their first prospectus. Planet Labs sought to be a ""One to Many"" data provider, and their main selling point was that earth data could be widely commercialized. While this is still fundamentally true, in the time since going public they have essentially become a government contractor (75% revenue from some form of government with only a quarter from general business use) (source: Q2 Investor Presentation). Revenue being sourced primarily from the government is two sides of the same coin and the value lies in the eye of the beholder: it's bad because they are too reliant on too few customers, or that government revenue is extremely sticky and a major growth driver under the right administration. I am of the latter opinion.

I think we are at an inflection point that could cause Planet Labs to become far more profitable than they are currently, which will cause their valuation to adjust higher (far higher than even their recent run-up). While the use cases for the their data is very broad, it has become evident in the last few years that the most profitable one is government use.

**My thesis lies in the following:**

1. Donny and a Republican majority House/Senate will have a much larger Defense and Intelligence budget. They will be willing to pay a premium to obtain top tier defense and intelligence data from vendors like $PL.
2. NATO contract is highly promising (https://spacenews.com/planet-signs-deal-with-nato-to-supply-satellite-imagery/) and is a first of its kind deal. Follow-on mandates to come if $PL executes.
3. Launch of Tanager-1 (a first of its kind methane specific tracking satellite - highly valuable for int'l governments seeking to gather data on parties with the most harmful emissions) and subsequent release of data should bolster top-line (new sales team will hopefully execute).

Also before you ask, why can‚Äôt RKLB, SpaceX, etc. just strap cameras to their rockets? Or why can‚Äôt Starlink tack some cameras on their satellites? Boiled down most simply: they can‚Äôt do it efficiently or cost-effectively. They‚Äôd have to divert time and resources away from their primary businesses (which already have their own significant challenges) just to fight an uphill battle; this can be discussed more at length if clarity is needed but I just don‚Äôt see it as a likely scenario. Generally speaking this would more likely materialize as a continued symbiotic relationship (Planet Labs uses SpaceX rockets to launch their satellite constellations for example).

**Other thoughts:**  
Larger market cap compared to closest peer, no debt, invests more heavily in development of new technologies (I view this as a plus long term - they understand that earth images can be commoditized and are spending heavily to develop a suite of analytics products which can materially enhance user experience - this will create competitive advantage long-term; and yes before you ask, their data is being used to train AI models - see Laconic deal today - perfect example of their R+D spend beginning to pay off), recently trimmed workforce (leaner operating structure), largest and highest-quality satellite fleet (and it's not even close - actually a staggering difference), multiple partnerships with Google (Google owns \~12%), rumors are circling that they will finally announce positive adj EBITDA either this quarter or next (management has been targeting Q4)

**Position and Price Target**:  
I am planning to update this and positions continuously; I do believe in the growth of PL and will likely add on. May roll the 12/20‚Äôs, not decided yet.

Position:  
12/20/2025 $5C 9x  
4/17/2025 $5C 4x

Target: $PL 5/1/2025: $10/share

**TLDR:**  
Earth data used for defense and intelligence will become significantly more valuable over the next year due to major administrative tailwinds. Donny's Department of Defense will award more government contracts at a higher value, which will finally let them scale in the way they were meant to (R+D, Capex, and cash burn from last few years will all be justified by a stronger top-line). The mature business model for $PL is essentially a software company with high gross margins. The margin expansion will finally be realized as more contracts are awarded and valuations will correct accordingly. Additionally, while they do seek to serve a wide array of industries (i.e. agriculture, natural resources, etc.) the biggest short term tailwinds (I think) will be defense and intelligence contracts.

Also - it is impossible to have covered all the bases in this, so shoot your questions below and let's discuss. Happy to try and answer/clarify any of the above points. Lastly, I am a complete regard lol I could be wrong; not financial advice."

It's a ridiculously large conglomerate of mostly loss-leading industries.

The primary drivers of income are the E-Commerce, Cloud, and Logistics segments, which subsidize the high growth subsidiaries.

I'm not going to dive into the business qualitatively, although there's plenty of qualitative reasons to be bullish on China at this point:

1. [PCAOB has full access to the accounting for Alibaba](https://pcaobus.org/news-events/news-releases/news-release-detail/pcaob-secures-complete-access-to-inspect-investigate-chinese-firms-for-first-time-in-history#:~:text=Public%20Company%20Accounting%20Oversight%20Board,time%20in%20history%2C%20in%202022); PwC (Big 4) is Alibaba's auditor
2. [Tech Crackdown has essentially been over for a year.](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3227753/timeline-chinas-32-month-big-tech-crackdown-killed-worlds-largest-ipo-and-wiped-out-trillions-value)
3. [Stock recently connected to the Chinese exchanges, allowing Chinese citizens to purchase the stock](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US/document-1769951994501398528)¬†(it has never dipped below the price of $83/share, where it traded on September 9 prior to this inclusion. Chinese owners have only ever seen green)
4. [Alibaba's Qwen AI is topping the charts in model ranking.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibabas-large-language-model-tops-093000912.html)¬†(Just don't ask it about Tiannanmen Square)
5. [China is gearing up a massive stimulus plan.](https://in.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/this-is-when-china-is-likely-to-present-new-significant-fiscal-stimulus-plan-db-4552712)

These are all certainly catalysts, but I think the fundamental analysis is far more interesting.

Based on their trailing 12 month earnings and current balance sheet, at 200B Market Cap, Alibaba trades on these multiples:

|Multiple|BABA|S&P500|S&P 500 Premium (Discount)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|1.5|3.1|106%|
|P/E|17.7|29.7|67%|
|Operating Margin|15%|12%|(25%)|
|P/OI (Operating Income)|10|25.8|158%|
|Forward P/E|10|24|140%|
|P/B|1.55|5|223%|
|P/FCF|11|24.3|121%|
|EV/EBITDA|8.8|17.5|99%|
|PEG Ratio (Assuming 5% Growth)|3.5|6|71%|

Generic fundamental ratios look beautiful compared to the S&P 500 for BABA, but that's just the start.

Alibaba's net book value is highly liquid, with significant portions of its long term assets stored in equity investments. Realistically, Alibaba is both a China ETF with its equity holdings, and a core business.

Thus, subtracting book value from the market cap and using operating income gives us a better picture of the market's valuation of Alibaba's earnings (which excludes gains/losses from interest+investments)

|Metric|BABA|SP500|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Market Cap|200B|\~48T|
|P/B Ratio|1.5|5|
|Market Cap - Book  Value|67B|\~38T|
|Operating Income|20B|\~1.86T|
|Book Value Adj. Market Cap / Operating Income|3.35|\~20.4|

Just, wow. When you subtract Alibaba's net book value and place a multiple on the operating income alone, Alibaba trades at 3.35x income, as opposed to the SP500 index 20.4. That's a 508% premium for the SP500.

By the above metrics, Alibaba trades at a 50-75% discount to intrinsic value. Based on the current market cap, that's around 400-600B of intrinsic value.

**But wait! CHINA BAD!**

Absolutely, China Bad. So, let's caveat this with some data.

According to Polymarket, the highest yearly odds of China invading Taiwan is around \~20%.

Let's be as conservative as possible. Let's use Polymarket's highest yearly odds of China invading Taiwan as the odds of Alibaba stock going to Zero. Assuming Alibaba stock goes to Zero in this circumstance, let's see what the current market cap of Alibaba should be, adjusting for the risk, and using my bear case low end 400B intrinsic value.

|Alibaba Intrinsic Value|Chance of Happening|
|:-|:-|
|400B|80%|
|0 (War with China)|20%|

We take the calculated intrinsic value example (400B), multiplied by the chance of not going to zero (80%), and end up with 320B market cap, adjusted for the China Bad risk. That's **60% upside** from here.

In the bull case intrinsic value of 600B, multiplied by 80%, we end up with 480B market cap, adjusted for the China Bad risk. That's **140% upside** from here.

TL;DR: No matter how you slice it, even if you take the most conservative valuation metrics for Alibaba and pair them with the most bearish estimates of chance of war with China, Alibaba is still severely undervalued. Even a China bear could justify owning Alibaba at these prices.

Bigbear.ai is primed and ready for take-off,"# TL;DR:

BigBear.ai is flying under the radar but has massive potential. This is your chance to grab a future AI juggernaut while it's still cheap. There is a perfect storm of catalysts brewing (government contracts, strategic market positioning, and booming AI demand) - think Palantir but still in its early innings.

**What is it?**

Bigbear is an AI-powered decision-making and analytics platform with a strong focus on government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and intelligence agencies. Their software helps organizations predict, visualize, and act on complex data to drive better outcomes.

**Why has it been overlooked?**

1. Tiny market cap of around $550m.
2. Low institutional ownership of less than 10% - mostly VC and Retail (although this has been growing over the last few months).
3. Went public via SPAC so the share price dropped massively initially.

**What it has going for it**

1. Secured a 5-year $165m USD contract from the US Army in October - clearly working closely with government agencies.
2. 2024 Q3 22.1% revenue increase to $41.5m and an improved gross margin of 25.9%, despite a net loss of $12.2m.
3. It's cheap af - expecting FY24 revenue of up to $180m at just $550m market cap. Granted it is loss-making currently but so is RKLB, ACHR, etc..
4. Rated as a Strong Buy from Wall Street analysts.
5. Has diverse revenue streams in healthcare and warehousing, increasing addressable market (already have contracts with Amazon).
6. $437m¬†backlog as of latest earning call.
7. Acquired Pangiam in 2023, a leader in facial recognition tech (CEO was former Director of Homeland Security).
8. The share price has been steadily rising over the past few months, but has yet to explode.

**Catalysts going forward**

Here we get a bit theoretical but I believe there is huge upside here for a few reasons:

1. Trump in office - more spending on defence and domestic security budgets (facial recognition is great for finding illegal immigrants hmmm).
2. It comes across as massively undervalued given it's current revenue and growth potential - trading at just over 3x forward revenue vs Palantir at 45x forward revenue.
3. Institutional ownership is rising fast - smart money is catching on for good reason.
4. Trend-wise, this stock fits the profile of something that will absolutely skyrocket on any positive news. AI deeptech, DoD contracts, growing revenue, and hugely overlooked.
5. It currently has 80 open positions on linkedin and with around 500 employees, this suggests they are investing hard for growth.

Basically, this is your chance to get in early on the next PLTR.

üö®Bag-holder DD alert: TWLO ALL IN with nvda sprinkles üö®,"Maybe there is a bag-holder bug going around... I hope my case isn't too bad. 

Tldr:
I'm all in TWLO with nvda sprinkles because Twilio is an ""AI pick and shovel"" play that is being heavily slept on lol. AI is going to the moon. TWLO is also trading at a significant discount relative to its SaaS peers. 

Just look at its weekly chart. Durrrr. 

Also, I don't think I have to say anything about NVDA besides ""buy the dip.""

Real TLDR at very bottom if you don't wanna read. 




Why am I being regarded?


1. I've been inspired by people like ElonIloveyou or whatever that guy's name is, and hopefully, if I hop on the wave quick enough, I can ride it to Valhalla :) 


2. TWLO is SO cheap right now

Although it fell fantastically... what goes down must always go up?

- Current Price-to-Sales (P/S): 2.6x

This is drastically lower than SaaS peers like Snowflake (25x) or ServiceNow (14x). For context, Twilio‚Äôs P/S ratio peaked at 20x plus during its high-growth phase in 2021.

- Enterprise Value (EV) to Revenue: 3.8x 

This is also much lower than peers (Smartsheet at 5.6-5.7x, ServiceNow at 12.5-13.8x, ZoomInfo at 7.7x).


3. Although they aren't profitable (who tf is and who cares), their revenue growth is strong and growing and their & margins are healthy.

- Revenue (TTM): $4.07 billion (a solid 10% YoY growth in a tough macro environment)

- Gross margins are stabilizing at 50%

- Cash Balance: $3.8 billion

TWLO has also maintained very low debt compared to peers


4. TWLO has many tailwinds

- Twilio‚Äôs recent initiatives include embedding generative AI and predictive analytics into its platforms. TWLO's most recent guidance signaled this advancement to be a significant revenue driver long term.

- Twilio has implemented significant cost-cutting measures and achieved $150 million in annualized savings in Q3 - by focusing on core high-margin products while exiting non-core businesses (Prolly some more tech layoffs around the corner across the board).

- Valuable collabs with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Salesforce enhance Twilio‚Äôs market reach.

- The global CPaaS (Communications Platform as a Service) market is expected to grow from $12 billion in 2023 to $35 billion by 2030, representing a CAGR of ~16%. Twilio dominates this space.

- HEAVY INSTITUTIONAL ACCUMULATION HAS OCCURRED RECENTLY. Vanguard and BlackRock have increased their stakes. The big fish are confident in the TWLO turn aruond story.


5. The technical ANALysis says calls, I think.  

- TWLO has broken above its 200-day moving average

- Key support levels: $102, $98.50, $92.

- Resistance levels: $110, $115, and $120.

- High open interest in near-term $110 and $115 calls, super DUPER low IV... maybe for a reason, but idk.


TLDR:
TWLO Is Primed for Upside because:

- Twilio is heavily discounted on all valuation metrics, providing a high margin of safety.

- AI-driven products and cost optimizations are setting the stage for sustained margin growth.

- Technical and options data suggest growing institutional and retail interest.

If you‚Äôre looking for a quality tech SaaS play at value-stock prices, Twilio deserves a spot on your radar. Shares and/or options will definitely hit, probably. 

I posted my positions. Not sure when I‚Äôll sell‚Ä¶I will likely be the catalyst for the next leg up.

MRNA bounce incoming ,"Good evening degens.  Last weekend I made a DD about NVDA breaking its upward trend line this week and selling off.  The post was downvoted to hell and I was called regarded.  Although I am highly regarded, that call out was not, and I was right.  I have another play for next week I‚Äôd like to share.  

We all remember Moderna(MRNA) from the Covid era.  The stock ran from $30 to $500 in about a year and a half.  It has since been absolutely butt fucked into oblivion.  Covid shot revenue is drying up and they are scrambling to find other sources.   On top of that, RFK plans to basically put them out of business(if he gets approved, which I don‚Äôt think he will).   Regardless, this play is not long term, although I do think this is a really good buy spot if you are hopeful about their long term business(which you should be).  Also, the stock got an upgrade from hold to buy by HSBC with a $58 price target, and there were multiple articles pondering whether the stock was sold off enough to warrant buying here, all of which advise buying.  These articles don‚Äôt mean shit, but it‚Äôs positive sentiment.  

Again,  THIS IS A SHORT TERM PLAY.  LIKE ONE WEEK, MAYBE TWO.  Now for the charts.   You can see on the daily it‚Äôs been in a solid downtrend since it had a little run in May.  But I think that is coming to end this week, at least temporarily.  The price double bottomed nicely at $35 last week.  I‚Äôve been looking for this level because this was resistance/support 4 different times back in 2020(long time ago, but in my brain it matters).  I think this will be a hard number to crack, especially since selling seems to be exhausted.  Those selling at this level are very likely selling for a large loss, and I think those that want to jump ship have already done so.  

On the daily, we are right on the trend line and the stock is at support.  This is the EXACT same setup as NVDA last week, except NVDA was breaking down after a big run, and I expect MRNA to break up after a massive ass whooping.  You can also see that volume has been much higher the past 2 weeks.  I believe smart, wealthy buyers are stepping here and loading the boat, and some are buying short term call options for next week, which brings me to the put call ratio.  

The first graph is the put call ratio for this past week.  You can see a slightly bullish lean with a ratio of 0.5, but there was a fair amount of put open interest at the 42,41, and 30 strikes, all of which expired worthless.  The next graph is the open interest for next week.  A ratio of 0.24 is extremely bullish, with 31,634 active call options and 7,536 puts.   You do not have that kind of ratio on a stock that‚Äôs been sinking like the Titanic unless smart money thinks that the selling is done and the stock is due for a reversal.   I was on the fence about this play until I looked at the option chain. 

I‚Äôm currently in the 12/6 45 calls.  I‚Äôm hoping to see a clear break of the trend line monday or Tuesday on strong volume, and would love to see a test of $50 at some point.  If i see a clear rejection at the trend line and it looks like it‚Äôll test $35 again, I‚Äôll stop out.  I‚Äôm pretty confident in this one tho, about as confident as I was in the NVDA play.  

Best of luck if tailing, and this is not financial advice.  

"
A Lot of Potential For $ZTO,"Yes, funny lines go *brrrrrrrr*.

Anyways, the YTD pattern thus far for $ZTO seems to indicate that buy/sell volume is cyclical, while maintaining a very nice positive slope for the bottoms. RSI(14) indicates it is oversold right now, and for every time this year that $ZTO has been oversold, the price of the shares will move back up from that point. Conversely, qhen the RSI is overbought, it goes down. The fact that this pattern can be observed is why I have bought options contracts at the strikes I did *($20-$22 strikes-ish, see in 2nd pic)*

$ZTO is a solid Chinese giant with 26 analyst ratings that give it a 92% buy score, with a target price of $21.20/share.

The companies rolls in a profit of $1.2B, with sales of about $5.83B, and has very low to non-existent debt of 0.01 LTDebt/Eq and pays roughly a 5% dividend. It has a nice low, but positive P/E of 13, and EPS has been positive through the year. There isn't much to not like about this stock right now.

If you're feeling frisky, buy some call options like I did, otherwise, this is a company I would buy shares outright for and wait for the next top to sell off at. I'm personally expecting a movement to the target price before January 17th.

Thank you for reading."
I have reasons to believe that Recursion (RXRX) will became quite popular in the next month.,"I believe that in the future, drugs will be highly customisable based on the patience‚Äôs health history. Based on your physiology, syndromes, and genetics, you may receive a drug that is well-suited for you and only you. 

How can you do that? First and foremost, you need data, huge amounts of it. We all know how generative and predictive models had advanced in the last year. It wasn‚Äôt in fact, until the launch of AlphaFold (by Google, whose team was recently awarded with the Chemistry Nobel Prize), that AI drug discovery became prominent. This open source model is used for molecular discovery. Again, would be nice if a company could:

1. Generate proprietary synthetic, good quality molecular data using models like AlphaFold.
2. Using this data to train models for drug discovery, reducing pipelines costs and times up to 50%.
3. Eventually, with the possibility of bringing the first AI-aided drug to the market.

First two points have been achieved, and the company is Recursion. We may know them because NVIDIA invested 50m in them. Why then are at ATL? I think the answer is time. We all know there is no room for patience when it comes to money sometimes. Training and bringing such results may take years.

However, I think another catalyst is coming. On 9. December, they will host a seminar for new readouts in one of their most well-known drugs in development, CDK7, for advance solid tumours (an inhibitor, which are currently none approved by the FDA).

Now, I am not saying that they will cure cancer - that‚Äôs BS. But over the years converging to novel oncological solutions using AI? This is not the only drug they have (other 9 are in development).

They have more than 60 petabytes of data.
They combined forces with Exscientia recently, forming probably the most important powerhouse of AI-drug research.
They are extremely active in the research field (see their presence in the upcoming NeuRIPS conference) or their new open dataset for Quantum Computing (OpenQDC).

I started investing in IONQ in 2021 for a similar impression. Now I am getting the same vibes with this. I feel that a small catalyst will put this to fly, although the real potencial will come in the next 5-10 years. If they can bring the first AI drug to the market,  this implodes.

Of course, no financial advice. I‚Äôm long 800 shares and loading as much as I possibly can."
ERJ - This stock is challenging two behemoths and I like their chances,"This is obviously not financial advice. I just like the stock and I want to talk about it.

Embraer recently hit it's highest price in the last 10 years and it comes after a disastrous failed merger with Boeing in 2020. They spent years prepping the company for the merger and were left with their dicks hanging out when Boeing backed out last minute (Broke ass Boeing didn't have the money to go thru with the acquisition). It was the best thing that could've ever happened to them. 

With a new CEO and a new direction, Embraer is setting itself up to challenge both Boeing and Airbus in the near future. They're already the third largest commercial air aircraft manufacturer in the world and their market share only increases with the higher demand from Airlines for fuel efficient aircrafts and their growing Military and private jet segments.

Embraer aircrafts will soon be 100% of American Airline's regional fleet and many other orders to come. Also, passengers absolutely love the experience of flying on an Embraer. 

Another interesting thing about Embraer is their track record on innovation. I'd recommend you guys researching and reading up on their EVE project. They're basically leading the field in the urban air mobility segment (basically taxi/uber but with planes) and it seems very promising. They are developing a small electric aircraft intended to be used for short urban travel (up to 100 KM /60 miles).

That being said, I have to confess one the biggest reasons I like ERJ is because it would be a tremendous FUCK YOU to Boeing if they stole their share of the market. ERJ to the fucking moon. 

I'm absolutely new to the stock game and should not be trusted. But I do invite you guys to learn more about this company.

If one of you regards want to take a look at their Q3 returns, here is the link: https://embraer.com/global/en/news?slug=1207478-earnings-results-3rd-quarter-2024 

I also would recomend reading this interview from their CEO. He shares his vision for the future of the company and how they want to get there:https://fortune.com/2024/10/21/ceo-embraer-aerospace-company-rewrote-strategy-boeing-joint-venture-loss-francisco-gomes-neto/

"
$OKLO is Undervalued Relative to $SMR,"It‚Äôs mind-boggling that Oklo trades at¬†**\~37%**¬†of NuScale‚Äôs market cap ($2.6B vs $6.9B). I strongly believe this valuation disparity will eventually correct. For context, if Oklo were valued similarly to NuScale, its share price could exceed¬†**$58/share**.

Oklo is positioned to lead the domestic nuclear sector;

* Capital Efficiency: arguably the healthiest balance sheet amongst SMR projects, having enough cash on hand to fund through their initial builds, with a low burn rate.
* Strong Leadership: executive leadership team with PhDs, Sam Altman as chairman, and a current board member slated to lead the Energy sector (Chris Wright.) Jake and Caroline (founders) are extremely passionate about the technology and opportunity, signaling to investors that they are keeping their equity for the long haul.
* Proven Technology: EBR-II operated through decades of testing between 1964-1994 at INL, clearly demonstrating that the molten sodium fast reactor can operate reliably and efficiently overtime.
* First-mover Advantage: Aurora is on target towards 2027 deployment at INL. Oklo has had the most regulatory engagement relative to other advanced reactor projects and have hired on a lot of former NRC regulatory staff. Also, unlike their competitors, they‚Äôve already secured fuel from the DOE for their first Aurora build.
* Commercialization Model: their ‚Äòowner and operator‚Äô model will allow them to scale rapidly and profitably alongside AI data centers throughout the 2030s. NRC whitepapers suggested that subsequent site reviews will take as little as 7 months, and Oklo will be able to debt finance project builds through future projected cash flows. They currently have 2.1GW in customer commitments, most notably from Equinix and Wyoming hyperscale.
* Alternative Revenue Streams: Oklo has positioned itself to benefit from other revenue sources; uranium recycling to repurpose fuel from nuclear waste reserves, and the manufacturing of radioisotopes through the recently proposed acquisition of Atomic Alchemy.

In contrast, NuScale is in a much worse position with regard to timelines:

* NuScale doesn‚Äôt have any construction or operating licenses, they only have a design certification for their 12x50MW plant. In order for their customers to obtain those licenses, it requires a 24-36 month NRC review period that¬†**has not been initiated yet**. This is why NuScale was projecting their first builds in early 2030s, which is years behind Oklo‚Äôs 2027 target and that‚Äôs probably being optimistic (as you‚Äôll see below).
* The reason why OKLO is so much further ahead is because they are submitting a COLA, which seeks approval for design, construction and operating, only taking them 24 months. Compare this to NuScale, where¬†**every individual customer**¬†needs to create and submit detailed plans, then wait 24-36 months for build and operating licenses.
* It was a strategic choice by NuScale and others to only sell designs and not be an ‚Äòowner and operator‚Äô like Oklo. They would have to commit to the responsibility of building and running the reactors themselves, which does come with additional hurdles and liability, but allows for¬†**much faster**¬†scaling.
* Putting aside those timelines, Nuscale‚Äôs 12x50MW plant was found to be¬†**not economically viable**, so they are back to get a standard design approval for their 6x77MW plant. Considering this factor along with the licensing timelines, their 6x77MW will likely take until 2033 for customer deployment.

Looking ahead, there is significant potential for an OpenAl partnership to materialize in the wake of all the demand that we've been seeing. Sam Altman recently visited DC to pitch lawmakers on the need for multiple 5GW data centers and pushed for the NRC to further streamline SMR approvals to meet those needs. If Oklo would be able to supply just a fraction OpenAl's future energy consumption, that would translate to a massive recurring revenue stream. Combine this with the fact that they are entering a more friendly regulatory environment, especially with Chris Wright heading the DOE under the Trump administration.

**TLDR:**¬†$SMR is far behind $OKLO in licensing timelines (by as much as 6+ years) and it does not appear to be reflected in the market. Aside from the obvious timeline advantage, Oklo stands to benefit from their capital efficiency, leadership team, first-mover advantage, commercialization model, and diversified revenue mix. If Oklo was trading at NuScale‚Äôs valuation (which I see as realistic), we‚Äôd be looking at over¬†**$58/share**."
Why $SPY is the Real Thanksgiving Turkey ü¶É,"Alright degenerates, gather round the table because I‚Äôve cooked up some sweet Thanksgiving DD, and no, it‚Äôs not cranberry sauce (but this could be just as saucy). Here‚Äôs the deal: Thanksgiving isn‚Äôt just about stuffing your face and awkwardly dodging Aunt Karen‚Äôs questions about why you‚Äôre ""still single""‚Äîit‚Äôs also PRIME TIME for unsolicited stock and crypto pitches at family dinners. And that, my friends, is why Black Friday is not just for TVs at 80% off, but also for **stupidly green markets.**

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Family Financial Influencers‚Ñ¢:** Grandpa brings up how he‚Äôs *still* holding Exxon since the 80s, your cousin Chad flexes his crypto portfolio (which is 90% down, but whatever), and your tech-savvy niece just learned about AI stocks and is suddenly Jim Cramer. Everyone at the table is buzzing with ""hot picks"" while passing the mashed potatoes. This is not financial advice‚Ä¶ but it kinda is.
2. **The FOMO Catalyst:** Uncle Bob hears about ""some stock with a weird ticker"" (it‚Äôs ACHR, Bob, get with it) and thinks, ‚ÄúWhy the hell am I not in this?‚Äù By the time the pumpkin pie rolls around, he‚Äôs downloading Robinhood. Multiply Uncle Bobs across America, and boom, retail frenzy ensues Friday morning.
3. **Markets are Closed Thursday:** This is key. People have 24 whole hours to stew in their newfound *knowledge*. By the time the market opens Friday, all that pent-up Thanksgiving YOLO energy explodes into buying pressure. Everyone‚Äôs a financial genius after 3 glasses of wine and a turkey coma.
4. **Black Friday Greenery:** You know how everyone shops like maniacs on Black Friday? Stocks are no different. This is the ""stock market doorbuster effect."" Everyone's piling into stocks like they‚Äôre $5 air fryers. And best of all, it‚Äôs also the gateway to the ‚ÄúSanta Claus rally.‚Äù As Christmas shopping kicks off, so might the stock market's annual tradition of going full holiday cheer mode. It‚Äôs like the market whispering, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been good this year, here‚Äôs a little green to celebrate.‚Äù üéÖüìà

# My Prediction for Friday:

* **$SPY** opens green (duh): Like your drunk uncle's karaoke rendition of ""Sweet Caroline,"" it‚Äôs inevitable.
* **Tech stocks?** Probably up because Aunt Susan heard about AI once on The Today Show and now thinks it‚Äôs the key to immortality (it is).
* **Crypto?** Let‚Äôs be real‚ÄîCousin Chad is hyping Bitcoin like he‚Äôs got Satoshi on speed dial. It‚Äôs probably gonna pump harder than Grandma‚Äôs blood pressure when she finds out you brought store-bought pie.
* **Random meme stocks?** Oh yeah, because someone‚Äôs cousin brought up ‚Äúthat one company with the short interest that shall not be mentioned.‚Äù
* **ACHR?** $ACHR will be taking a flight (literally and figuratively) this Friday‚ÄîWSB's favorite bird is ready to soar, and you degenerates are gonna love it. üöÅüí∏

**TL;DR:** Thanksgiving isn‚Äôt just about turkey‚Äîit‚Äôs a breeding ground for half-baked stock ideas. When Friday rolls around, we‚Äôre gonna see a tsunami of retail money hit the markets. $SPY gonna pop, and we‚Äôll all be riding the gravy train. **To the moon or the Wendy's dumpster, GODSPEED** ü´°

*Disclaimer:* This is absolutely NOT financial advice‚Äîjust a turkey-fueled theory for entertainment purposes only. If it somehow works, consider sharing some pumpkin pie and maybe a thank-you card. üöÄ

MSTR: Don't Mistake Leverage for Genius [DD],"Microstrategy (MSTR) has a simple strategy of using various forms of debt to buy bitcoin. Regardless of your stance on Bitcoin, it begs the question: **why** invest in Microstrategy over Bitcoin? In the words of Steve Eisman, ‚ÄúThey mistook¬†*leverage for genius*.‚Äù

Sure, Microstrategy is more leveraged than Bitcoin, but you can also leverage your bet on Bitcoin; take out margin, buy a leveraged instrument on an exchange, or, my favorite, taking an extra shift at Wendy's.

So, let's compare the strategy. How would you do if you just bought leveraged Bitcoin instead of Microstrategy, and mimicked their strategy? I'll walk us through returns from the bottom of the BTC bear market on December 30, 2022, until today.

On 30 December 2022, MSTR had a market capitalization of **1.63B.** They held **132,500 bitcoin** valued at $**2.19B** according to their Q4 earnings.

https://preview.redd.it/dw36tu03oa3e1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=783ed81a61bb033f974783e70fe2c51899d6325f

Bitcoin was around 16,529 on December 30 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/acmcnyhhoa3e1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fc1f50ffa72683d4fc448fe2ef98720ace19ff9

They also had total long term debt of $2.4B.

https://preview.redd.it/k9zzwx15oa3e1.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=afa6a2fb9169bf7ec53956d8412f04af423e6316

Note, I'm excluding their current debt and assets from this, as I'm more interested in their BTC holdings vs. their long term liabilities (debt).

Importantly, their core loss-leading operating business was generating about $30M a year of EBITDA. You could easily value this at **Zero**, but a generous 20X multiple of 30M EBITDA would be valued at around \~$600M

https://preview.redd.it/rlnskdbaoa3e1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3029489eb18d94bea7955fd3313210b3a2870eb

So, you were buying a $600M operating business and $2.19B of bitcoin, minus $2.4B in debt, for 1.63B market cap.

Assuming you could just sell the operating business to cover debt and focus on the value of the bitcoin, that would be **$2.19B in bitcoin** and $**1.8B in debt**. So net assets of **390M**.

Owning 2.19B in bitcoin on 390M of net assets is about **5.6x** leverage.

If you took the same 1.63B needed to buy all of MSTR‚Äôs market cap at the time and bought bitcoin at 5.6x leverage you would own $**9.128B worth of BTC**, or about **552,241 BTC** at the December 30 2022 prices.

With BTC at 93K today, you would have turned your $1.63B into **$51.3B** if you used 5.6x leveraged BTC, a **3,106%** ROI.

How did MSTR do over the same time period?

https://preview.redd.it/cyc8kfjxoa3e1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0aac60559159b94bc2815e0bbba7ccfb7d5e5b6

Over the same duration, even with NAV premium expansion, MSTR has returned 2,452%. That's the difference between turning your 1.6B into 41B or 51B. A huge discrepancy!

TLDR; Adjusting for leverage based on MSTR‚Äôs bitcoin holdings vs debt, you would have been better off just buying leveraged bitcoin.

FNMA: Come back in 2026/2027,"For those of us that have followed the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac trades since they went into conservatorship, my theory is that it's worth waiting until the end of 2026. Here's my thinking:

* Political
   * Trump likely wants to privatize Fannie and Freddie. He looked into it his first time but the major things holding it back were capital reserves and political will.
   * With a Trump 2nd term, reducing the size of government is one of his biggest goals. In general, privatization is one of the most common ways of doing this. Given that Fannie and Freddie were taken over in 2008, this makes them a prime candidate to be re-privatized. 
   * Republicans have the power in Congress at the moment. 
* Financial
   * At the time, based on the plan and rules they would need about $275-300B in reserves. They currently have about $165B in reserves. In recent years, they generate about $25B in net income per year. While that's about a $100B gap, they can also raise capital through private and public means (private investors, issuing stock). 

Why 2026? Pure speculation from here on:

* Financial
   * In 2 years, they will be in a better capitalized position. They will likely have made about $50B more in income, thus having a total of about $215B in reserves and about a $50B gap in capitalization needed. Given their economics and situation, it could be a tempting investment for investors (particularly hedge funds). 
* Political
   * While this is in line, philosophically, with what Trump wants to do, it won't be a money saver and thus not likely a priority under say DOGE. This would be more symbolic and thus, in my thinking, is a lower priority. 
   * I'm guessing 2024-2026 will be somewhat politically turbulent. This will be the time that Trump takes his biggest swings in terms of cuts to the government since the Republicans control Congress. They will expend political capital to make controversial changes. Therefore, they will focus on their highest priority changes.
   * We have to see what happens to Congress in the 2026 elections. In recent history, Congress has changed power from one political party to another (I believe in 2008 Dems won power under Obama, but then Republicans gained power in 2010). If the Dems win back the balance of power in 2 years, there may not be the political will to privatize. The Dems will sell a fear message around housing affordability, increased costs to borrowers so that they can retain power and control over an important political tool. 

Conclusion

If I were to place odds, it feels feels like a latter-half Trump term initiative. And the best odds are only if Republicans retain power in both houses of Congress in order to pass a bill to make this happen. They're in healthy positions but a couple more years of making money will put them in a financial sweet spot for it to be supported by politicians. 

Even then, it's quite complex and likely is years in the making. But the stock will move if the possibility of privatization in the near term becomes visible. 

If Democrats take power back in Congress in 2026, this isn't a place I'd bent money. Same goes if they win the presidency in 2028. There's also a possibility that the government wants to make major changes to how these types of government-sponsored enterprises are structured, making privatization a much more complicated matter."
"Kohl's (KSS) at $15 - Seriously Undervalued, Here's Why üöÄ","Alright, gang, hear me out. I think (Kohls) KSS is an absolute gem right now, sitting at $15. Here's the case:

1. Franchise Group tried to buy KSS at $69 per share in April 2022 üí∏Yeah, you read that right. Franchise Group was willing to pay $69 for Kohl's not even two years ago. The deal was rejected (major facepalm move on Kohl's part), but it gives us a benchmark for what the market thought KSS was worth. Now, let‚Äôs take a moment to think about why Franchise Group was willing to pay that much... This wasn't some random offer. Kohls has value. It's just undervalued right now.
2. Oak Street Real Estate Deal ‚Äì A $2B Real Estate Portfolio üè¢After that rejection, Oak Street stepped in and made an offer to buy a portion of Kohl's real estate for $2B. Wait‚Äî$2 billion for a portion of the real estate? At the current market cap of $1.65 billion, that tells you one thing: Kohl's real estate alone is worth more than the ENTIRE company. If we‚Äôre being conservative, the real estate portfolio could easily be worth $4-5 billion, which is well above where the stock is trading right now. So, the company‚Äôs assets are massively underpriced.
3. 32% Short Interest ‚Äì Don‚Äôt need to tell you guys about potential, you know the drill.
4. Seasonal Play ‚Äì December to January Pop Historically, Kohl‚Äôs stock tends to do well in the December to January timeframe, often gaining around 25-30%. Worst-case scenario, you‚Äôre breaking even based on the past 5 years if you‚Äôre holding through this period, but with the setup here, I‚Äôd bet on a solid upside. Buy in December, sell in January, rinse and repeat.

TL;DR

\* Franchise Group offered $69 for Kohl's in 2022. The stock is $15 today.

\* Oak Street valued Kohl's real estate at $2B for a portion. That‚Äôs a huge asset undervaluation.

\* 32% short interest

\* December to January historically sees a 30% upside.

So, what‚Äôs the risk at $15? This stock is undervalued and has additional catalysts.

"Stock is Trading at All-Time Lows with a Sub-$2B Market Cap, $600M FCF, $4B in Assets, and Over 30% Short Interest‚Äî Absurd.","Apollo tried to fund a Kohls buyout in 2022 for 8B (nothing has changed drastically about its business between now and then).

Let‚Äôs break down Kohl‚Äôs ($KSS). The stock is down 20% today, trading at an all-time low with a market cap under $2 billion. Meanwhile, the company generates $600 million in free cash flow (FCF) annually and owns $7 billion in real estate assets. with net assets of $4B.

1.The Business: Kohl‚Äôs still did $18 billion in sales for fiscal 2024, even without fully capitalizing on its Sephora partnership, which is boosting foot traffic in every store its been rolled out in (and they continue to roll out more) .

2. Valuation and Cash Flow: ‚Ä¢	Kohl‚Äôs generated $300 million in net income last fiscal year and nearly double that in free cash flow (FCF): $600 million. Based on this quarter they‚Äôll likely land somewhere in a similar ball park. ‚Ä¢	Historically, Kohl‚Äôs has averaged $1 billion in FCF, meaning current results are already deeply discounted. And yet, the stock is trading at just 3x FCF. ‚Ä¢	The discrepancy between net income and FCF comes from non-cash expenses like depreciation on their $7 billion real estate portfolio. This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmoney burned‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs accounting noise.

3. Balance Sheet Strength: ‚Ä¢	Kohl‚Äôs has $14 billion in total assets/4B net, with a large portion being real estate. They own over 400 stores outright‚Äîhard assets that could generate significant cash in a liquidation scenario. ‚Ä¢	Liabilities are about 11B, Yes, they exist, but Kohl‚Äôs is far from distressed, with manageable debt relative to their assets and FCF generation.

4. Short Interest: ‚Ä¢	Over 30% of Kohl‚Äôs shares are shorted. Shorts betting on total collapse might not fully understand the cash generation and real estate value here. Any positive catalyst‚Äîa strategic pivot, real estate monetization, or improved retail sentiment.

5. CEO Departure: ‚Ä¢	Kohl‚Äôs just announced its CEO, Tom Kingsbury, is stepping down‚Äînews that likely contributed to today‚Äôs selloff. But here‚Äôs the kicker: Kingsbury was adamant about NOT selling Kohl‚Äôs assets. His departure reopens the possibility of a real estate monetization play, which could unlock billions in value.

    ‚Ä¢	Remember: Kohl‚Äôs rejected an $8 billion buyout offer funded by Apollo Global Management in 2022. That was four times today‚Äôs valuation.

The Bottom Line: For a $2 billion market cap, you‚Äôre buying: ‚Ä¢	$7 billion in real estate assets (including 400+ owned stores). ‚Ä¢	$600 million annual FCF, even in a ‚Äúbad‚Äù year. ‚Ä¢	A company that generates enough cash to pay an 11% dividend yield.

If you told me I could buy $7 billion in hard assets (4B net of liabilities) and $600 million in annual cash flow for under $2 billion, I‚Äôd say yes every time. That‚Äôs Kohl‚Äôs today. This isn‚Äôt a growth story‚Äîit‚Äôs a cash-and-assets story. You‚Äôre betting that the business, even if it declines slowly, will return far more than its current valuation. Or that someone with deep pockets will take notice and bid. Either way, this valuation is ridiculous.

Shorts, good luck.

üîã Bloom Energy‚Äôs 95% Run: The Hidden Energy Play Behind AI Data Centers,"**Bloom Energy (BE) surged 59% on Nov 15 and is now up 95%.**  
While it‚Äôs unclear if the rally will pause or continue‚Äîand you should be mindful that, as I just said, she has already soared 95%‚Äîthis post explores why this move is more than a short-term trend, with highly significant catalysts on the horizon.

[Bloom Energy servers](https://preview.redd.it/j6j1akk2x43e1.jpg?width=3912&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb781f61de55753b16b0ff00433654d603615d53)

AI is booming, and it‚Äôs not a fad. Have you heard of NVDA? Of course you have, and you know the demand for its semiconductors is insane. Here are key insights from last Wednesday‚Äôs NVDA earnings call:

* Hopper demand is exceptional.
* Blackwell demand is staggering.
* NVDA is racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand.
* The next wave of AI is Enterprise AI and Industrial AI.

\-----

AI isn‚Äôt just the future‚Äîit‚Äôs here and scaling rapidly. These semiconductors are being used to build advanced data centers. **But to turn on these data centers, you cannot just plug all that processing power into the wall outlet. They require specialized power setups from their local energy utility.**

Connecting a data center to the grid requires major upgrades due to their immense energy demands and need for reliability:

**Dedicated Substations:** Data centers need substations with high-capacity transformers and switchgear to step down grid power. Building or upgrading a substation can take 2‚Äì3 years due to permitting, engineering, and construction delays.

**Transmission Line Upgrades:** High-voltage lines may need new installations, conductor upgrades, or pole reinforcements, often delayed by land acquisition, environmental reviews, and public opposition.

**Distribution Network Enhancements:** Local networks require upgrades like redundant feeders, voltage regulators, and new lines to ensure stable delivery from substations to data centers.

**Redundancy and Reliability:** To meet 99.999% uptime demands, utilities need to build costly redundant systems, including backup transmission lines and ring configurations, to eliminate single points of failure.

Furthermore, data centers consume immense amounts of electricity, often beyond what utilities can supply. Slow by nature, utilities are vastly unprepared for the AI-driven demand surge, and they are struggling to respond.

Besides, upgrading grid infrastructure requires billions of dollars and takes years, with delays from zoning, public consultations, and environmental reviews. As a result, companies that want to develop their data centers face growing waiting lists for power, risking their competitive edge in an industry where delays of even months can be critical.

**This isn‚Äôt hypothetical‚Äîit‚Äôs happening now.** I‚Äôve included several sources and citations at the end.

\-----

Enter Bloom Energy ($BE), which sells on-site power generators that can run data centers **without relying on the grid**‚Äîa proven solution used for years in hospitals, factories, and off-grid installations.

On Nov 14 (after-hours), American Electric Power (AEP), a major utility that operates in 11 states and is struggling to meet data center energy demands, struck a deal with Bloom Energy. Instead of making clients wait years or relocate, AEP will offer Bloom‚Äôs energy servers, enabling data centers to power up in months, not years, and stay competitive.

This is a game-changer for Bloom Energy. They‚Äôve shifted from selling servers to individual clients to partnering with utility giant AEP‚Äîa move from retail to wholesale.

Bloom‚Äôs technology isn‚Äôt new, but the AEP deal marks a leap to scalable, utility-scale partnerships, unlocking massive demand.

\-----

A company wanting to develop a data center: ‚ÄúI need energy for my data center!‚Äù  
AEP: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be able to accommodate you until mid-2027. You can wait, move to a location where the grid is already upgraded (but you need to hurry because those spaces are limited), or we can install these Bloom Energy servers and you‚Äôll have your energy in 90 days.‚Äù

For those who grasp this jump from retail to wholesale, the opportunity is clear.  
Careful, though. My entry was over a week ago, and she has been running a lot already. However, every new AEP order or, fingers crossed, any other major utility signing a new agreement with Bloom Energy? Wink emoji.

Do your own research, though. And for those who want to dive deeper into the details, here are the sources I used to inform my play:

[AEP press release](https://www.aep.com/news/releases/read/9866/AEP-Leveraging-Fuel-Cell-Technology-to-Power-Data-Center-Growth)

Personally, I‚Äôm playing with shares ($18.24, and I'm posting now because I was BanBet-banned last week).  
And again, she could keep running north, but be careful. However, this stock is something you should keep on a watchlist.

\-----

TL;DR: Bloom Energy (BE) surged 59% after a deal with AEP, a major utility struggling to meet energy demands from AI-driven data centers. BE‚Äôs on-site energy servers bypass the grid, enabling data centers to power up in months instead of years. This shifts BE from retail to wholesale, unlocking massive potential.

DOJ doesn't understand software and why GOOGL is an obvious play,"so the government want to split Chrome off Google? this is a win win scenario for anyone who picks up any Google stock and Google itself:

1. They do split it. Google goes about it's business making billions and now Chrome belongs to someone else or in its own thing. Google can just launch a new browser off Chromium open source project. Heck even if somehow they are forbidden from ever launching a browser again they can get away influencing the Chrome foundation or whatever like they've done with Mozilla through partnership/donations. It's not like their core business is Chrome anyways. Same deal goes with Android they can fork or influence even post split. Maybe if they took YouTube they'd be hit badly but still carry on making dough off search alone.

2. They don't split it. Biz as usual but you just got in a good entry point.

I plan keep long on GOOGL but for now this is all I can afford

RedCat DD,"I‚Äôm back with the RedCat DD that I promised. 

RedCat is an American Drone company that, as of last week, has been chosen as the sole provider of small, rucksack portable, attritable drones bringing surveillance and strike capabilities, to none other than the United States Army. 

Through a program of record initiated 5 years ago, Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR), the US Army was able to test, research, evaluate and compare capabilities/limitations of drones from 37 companies including Boeing, Lockheed Martin and the ‚Äúreigning champion‚Äù from SRR tranche 1, Skydio. They also fielded these drones in Ukraine to determine resistance to electronic warfare and signal jamming in combat against a modernized and ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù near peer adversary. Needless to say, RedCat provided a far superior drone, purpose built for the warfighter and was subsequently chosen as the contract winner. 

‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs one little Army contract for around 12,000 drones, how is that important?‚Äù

Great question, looks like not everyone in this sub rides the short bus to school. 

As mentioned previously, SRR testing began in 2018. Now who was paying attention to something other than the big red line that was your portfolio in 2022? Just 4 years after the Army identified the potential viability of drones in wartime? Yep, you got it. Russia invaded Ukraine. Here‚Äôs a sticker for you to add to your helmet. If you haven't been watching the drone footage from the Ukrainian war, you should probably get on that. 

Drones have completely changed the battlefield. Ukrainian forces are currently using/losing at LEAST 10,000 drones a month, with some 30,000+ drones in the air everyday. To reiterate, 5 years ago, before Russia invaded Ukraine, before drones were proven in combat, before Ukraine was burning through 10,000 a month to fight one of our near peers, the Army decided they would like about 12,000. 

Do the math. Do you believe the largest and most powerful land force on Earth would order 2 weeks worth of drones and call it good? You know the answer to this question. Why don‚Äôt you have free medical care? Why do you have 100k in student loans? Why will an ambulance ride bankrupt you?

Fantastic, you‚Äôre right again. 13.3% of the US Federal budget goes straight to the DOD. A cool $820 billion. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre losing focus but I‚Äôm certain your wife‚Äôs boyfriend can keep her company for a little bit longer. Now add this one up. If you are engaged in conflict with another world power, where do you want to put your money? Do you want to buy the 50k drone that can target anything from the sky, completely unmanned, or do you want to spend 10 million on a single M1 Abrams tank that will take a critical hit from an FPV attack drone, killing the entire crew? 

Let me say this another way. You are America and will stop at nothing to maintain your position as the superior global superpower. Are you buying 5 tanks or 1,000 drones? 1,300 drones or a single F-18? 13,000 drones or 10 F-18‚Äôs? How about raising taxes and buying both.

I am not the Secretary of Defense but I can assume an intricate cost benefit analysis is being conducted by US military leadership. In the very near future, the DOD will be acquiring more than 12,000 drones, a whole lot more. 

In case you aren‚Äôt aware, the US Army is America‚Äôs largest branch of the armed forces. This means they have more money to R&D than their counterparts. With some second level thinking you can understand this to mean if another branch of the military can wait for a wealthier branch to spend millions/billions finding the best product, and buy it after they do, they‚Äôll do exactly that. This reality extends beyond the American DOD. 

How about Australia? Here‚Äôs a start. 

https://ir.redcatholdings.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/158/red-cat-to-supply-flightwave-edge-130-blue-systems-to-royal-australian-navy

‚ÄúRed Cat to Supply FlightWave Edge 130 Blue Systems to Royal Australian Navy‚Äù

I hypothesize allied armed forces have been patiently awaiting the conclusion of big Army‚Äôs testing to determine where they will also be sourcing their combat drones. SRR is really only the beginning. 

For those interested in semiconductor plays that also understand the importance of Taiwan, you might want to give these articles a read. 

https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2024-09/news/us-supply-taiwan-attack-drones

https://news.usni.org/2024/07/01/hellscape-swarms-could-be-as-cost-effective-taiwan-defense-says-report

The future of warfare is unmanned systems fighting other unmanned systems. Why did we leave Vietnam? Unpopularity back home, moms had enough of losing their sons. How long can America sustain a war outspending USD? When America‚Äôs cost of war is cheap drones instead of billions and American lives, we might just deter our adversaries in a way they don‚Äôt want to engage us anyways. 

That leads me to the next point. Drones as a deterrence factor. How many drones operating autonomously in a swarm is enough? How many does the entire DOD need on hand? How many do our allies want? 100,000? 200,000? A million? How many combat drones do you speculate that America‚Äôs military industrial complex wants on hand? I can‚Äôt give you a definitive answer so unfortunately you‚Äôll have to take a quick break from licking that window and use your own reasoning skills. I can say, however, that I‚Äôm pretty confident about where they will be sourcing these drones.

Now, enough ‚Äúmarket‚Äù analysis. Let‚Äôs talk about some numbers. u/CynicalMelody was kind enough to post this on a previous post of mine the other day.

‚ÄúHere is my prediction Stock Price Potential Based on Updated Calculations
Current Market Capitalization: $708.997 million

Current Stock Price: $9.39

Shares Outstanding: Approximately 75.5 million

Projected Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue: $100 million

Industry Revenue Multiple: 20√ó annual revenue

Implied Valuation:

Implied Market Capitalization: $100 million √ó 20 = $2 billion

Implied Stock Price: $2 billion / 75.5 million shares = Approximately $26.49 per share

Potential Upside: (($26.49 - $9.39) / $9.39) √ó 100% = Approximately 182% increase‚Äù

This analysis does not include what will be awarded in the future. 

The stock market is forward looking. Now look forward so you can get an edge. The US drone industry is currently estimated to be worth around 3.94B, expected to increase to 8.65B by 2034. 

https://www.precedenceresearch.com/military-drones-market#:~:text=Military%20Drones%20Market%20Size%2C%20Share,7.95%25%20between%202024%20and%202034

Sure maybe the American drone industry will only double over the next 10 years, the thing is, all bets are off if/when we go to war. Where will that money go? 

If you believe global tensions are rising and war is imminent, where is your capital going to be safest? This is your opportunity to build some conviction. How will the US stock market hold up if we go to war? Individual companies? How about if we don‚Äôt? Answer those same questions but with RedCat. We get sucked in and large scale war begins, VOO -25%, RCAT +60%. Place your bets.

By current business prospects, RCAT is criminally undervalued. It should have traded at $12 the moment the SRR winner was announced. Also, is there a more reliable source of consistent payments/business than providing services to the US military/government?

This image was not my work, but here is some price modeling data.



If you can buy cheaper than $12, you‚Äôre getting a deal. If you understand the gravity of the SRR win, there is much more to follow. This is a chance to buy something that you would hold for a year. Most of yall have never heard the word ‚Äúprofits‚Äù so taxes isn‚Äôt a problem for you, but for the 6 people in here that aren‚Äôt regarded, this is a play you can hold for a year and pay long term capital gains on your gains. Buy calls, exercise them or sell them, buy shares keep them, whatever you wanna do. This company is promising with a bright future. I do apologize that I didn‚Äôt post this earlier. I have been working with the mods to get this posted as soon as it was allowed. (Until a few days ago it‚Äôs been under 500M market cap. Wanted and tried to post DD back in July) 

Ask your questions and I‚Äôll do the best I can to answer them. 

Positions:

400,000 shares
700 RCAT 1C‚Äôs Jan 2025
800 RCAT 2C‚Äôs Jan 2025
1,700 RCAT 3C‚Äôs Jan 2025

I will also be exercising my calls at the start of the year."

Archer (ACHR): Over $6 and Counting‚ÄîThe Journey is Far from Over üöÄ,"**Alright everbody, let‚Äôs talk about where we‚Äôre at with ACHR:**

Since my first post back in October, Archer has climbed **over 100%** and now sits above **$6**. The steep incline has been exciting, but the journey is far from over. Here‚Äôs a look at what‚Äôs been happening. We‚Äôve got major news, strong forecasts, and institutional backing that keep this play looking solid. Let me break it down:

**Analyst Price Target are Bullish**  
Analysts are projecting an **average price target of $9.69,** with some forecasts reaching as high as **$13.12**. New coverage from Needham just slapped a **Buy** rating on it. The trajectory? Upward.

**381 Funds are on Board**  
Institutional interest in ACHR is growing, with **381 funds** now holding positions‚Äîup 8.55% last quarter. Total shares owned by institutions increased by over **10%**, showing confidence in Archer‚Äôs growth. Big money sees the potential.

**Insider Activity & Growing Buzz**  
Insider transactions over the past 12 months show strong confidence from within the company:

* **7 insider buys** totaling **28.7M shares**, with only **3 sells** amounting to **3.2M shares**.
* In the last 6 months alone, there were **3 insider buys** totaling over **20M shares**.

This aligns with the momentum we‚Äôve seen recently, with a flood of news, analyst ratings, and community discussions driving ACHR into the spotlight. The buzz isn‚Äôt just from the outside, people on the inside clearly see the potential too.

**Major NYC News**  
Archer‚Äôs partner **Skyports Infrastructure** and **Groupe ADP** have been selected to operate the **Downtown Manhattan Heliport**, a key move toward bringing electric air taxis to NYC. Together with **United Airlines**, the plan is to electrify the heliport and introduce quieter, cleaner, and more affordable urban air mobility for New Yorkers. This is a massive step forward.

**Global Expansion & Commercialization Strategy**  
Archer‚Äôs plans go beyond the U.S., they‚Äôre actively positioning themselves for deployment in the **Middle East, Asia, and India**, with key partnerships already in place. Their three-step commercialization strategy is set to begin as early as next year:

1. **Piloted demonstration flights** in key markets.
2. **Market survey trips** carrying passengers on initial air taxi routes.
3. **Full-scale commercial operations** post-certification.

India, with its large urban markets, is shaping up to be one of Archer‚Äôs biggest opportunities, supported by their partnership with **InterGlobe Enterprises**.

**Production Facility Nearing Completion**  
Archer‚Äôs new manufacturing facility is set to open in the coming weeks. This factory will begin producing **type-design aircraft** next year, ramping up to a production rate of **two aircraft per month by the end of 2025**, with plans to scale even further in 2026. This marks a significant step toward real-world operations and commercial readiness.

**The Journey Continues**  
For those already in, congrats on riding this wave. For those still watching, it‚Äôs not too late. After such a strong climb, while some might expect a pullback, in my view, consolidations aren‚Äôt guaranteed. Momentum has been holding steady, and the recent news flow has only strengthened the outlook. Even if there are minor dips, there‚Äôs no reason to get nervous. Let the doubters and short sellers be the ones sweating it out and reaching for the aspirin. With upcoming milestones like pilot flights and the manufacturing facility launch, the **short-term** and **long-term** potential both look strong.

**TL;DR:** ACHR is up over 100% but still has room to run. NYC, institutional backing, and bullish price targets are lining up to make this a big winner. The ride isn‚Äôt over yet, join if you‚Äôre ready to see what‚Äôs next. üöÄ

Wishing everyone a great Thanksgiving and hoping for some gains this week to cover an extra turkey or two! ü¶É

"Nuclear Power, Crypto, and Monday Moves","Hello, I am back to talk more about SMR, UEC, and now MSTR. When I posted about SMR a week or two ago several people said that it was a bad investment as it has already grown 600+ percent this year. Look at where the stock is now. After recent statements by the upcoming USA administration I think I have seen more tickers with potential to have short term gains as well as long plays. 

SMR has recently hit 30 dollars and will continue to peak I believe around 33 as a resistance after watching its chart for sometime. I believed that it would drop in price so I sold my positions at 27 dollars hoping to repurchase at 24. It is still at 28. I am going to go in with calls on this one. I believe it will increase in price steadily with sharp early market peaks. Pay attention to the volume.  If you can scalp a cheap mid jan put at a reasonable 20 something dollar range I believe it will be wise. People will be fearful of the oil energy bro in office but the dude is pro nuclear. 

The bitcoin talk about us being the capital is real. Thats why these shitcoins scammers are at an all time high look at tiktok and look at instagram reels. The normies believe this is their entry to crypto but XMR x UDC collab will most likely happen in the next 2 years so get ready for that one. BitCoin == next gold for backing the XDR == cash dollar. If trump wants to mine collect and purchase bitcoin this will innevitably be NuScales in for the government contracts as in its already its baby. UEC is still a play in the fact that it will continue to go up. Most likely based off my analysis it will hit 9.35 by christmas and hit an 8$-7.87 price point before the administration takes charge. Domestic production is back and that applies to UEC who is making moves with plans they cant share with you right now.

MSTR is like 4x bitcoin which means its going to explode up or down with price. I think the silkroad is going to comeback and take its toll on bitcoins value. When trump is talking about making us the capital for crypto that means the complete end of crypto privacy. Not everyone was busted. Drug dealers, cartels, government bribes, and illegal deals. They are all apart of its rise and its current holdings. They will sell off before the boom causing a tanking of MSTR's price. I too believe short term it will explode in value in the ROCKET direction. But normies buying at 87k 90k 95k will have a mass sell off as well when it hits 110-115k as that is a logical smooth brain move to buy a house.  They don't care about cycles or the bitcoin rainbow. 

  
This isn't a scam or a self plug. Everything I am saying is what I am going to play and not financial advice. But I would love to have a discussion with you guys while I play dota. IDK if I can link the the stream or not but I will be looking at charts and going over stories between matches and during games and death debating these plays. I have a lot to say about gold and a few recent success stories to show for my DD. Just let me know and Ill tell you my username so we can talk about these moves.

PLTR: They said the quiet part out loud [DD],"On November 15, 2024, PLTR's board member Alex Moore tweeted,

>We are moving PalantirTech to Nasdaq¬†because it will force billions in ETF buying and deliver 'tendies' to our retail investors. Player haters be aware that we've been hated for decades (plural). Everything we do is to reward and support our retail diamondhands following.

Immediately afterwards, he deleted his tweet.

At first glance, the statement seems harmless, and even obvious. Companies are added/removed from passive indexes every day, and it's not a crime to want to deliver shareholder returns. There's no problem with boasting about passive index inclusion. It doesn't affect the fundamental business anyway.

Right?

I think otherwise.

Alex Moore said Palantir's quiet part out loud. I contend that this has been Palantir's gameplan since day one.¬†**The stock's performance**, ridiculous valuation, and mania all¬†**points back to one fundamental goal**¬†of the company's management:¬†**manipulating stock market indexes to juice valuation and provide liquidity for insider selling.**

**The Evidence (s/o Mike Green):**

**Part 1: The Listing**

Companies generally list via a direct listing, traditional IPO, or SPAC. For a company the size of PLTR, a SPAC was out of the question. They had to choose between an IPO and direct listing. Let's take a look at both.

**Traditional IPO**: Typically involves investment banks underwriting the deal, setting a price, and selling shares to institutional investors like mutual funds or hedge funds. Importantly, these shares are¬†**not**¬†part of the stock's free float, and insiders must dilute themselves in order to create new shares to sell on the public market.

**Direct Listing**: In a direct listing, a company offers existing shares directly to the public without issuing new shares or raising capital. This avoids traditional IPO underwriters (investment bank). The free float is immediately determined by shares held by insiders available to sell. Palantir chose this route.

**Takeaway:**¬†In a¬†**direct listing**, all existing shares held by insiders, employees, and early investors become eligible for public trading immediately. There is¬†**no lock-up period**¬†(common in traditional IPOs, where insiders are restricted from selling shares for 6‚Äì12 months). This approach ensures a¬†**larger float**¬†right from the start, as insiders can sell their shares directly on the public market if they choose, increasing the number of shares available for trading.

Why is this important?

Palantir almost immediately qualified for index inclusion upon its first day of listing. Vanguard and others were forced to buy shares on the¬†**first week**¬†of listing because Palantir met the necessary requirements for most broad market indexes:

1. Market Cap - This is self explanatory, Palantir began listing at \~17B market cap, rendering it eligible for most indexes.
2. Free Float - Indexes are not just weighted by a company's market cap. The S&P500, for example, uses¬†**Float-Adjusted Market Cap**, adjusting the company‚Äôs market capitalization based on its free float to determine its weight in the index. Float-Adjusted¬†Market¬†Cap=Share¬†Price√óFree¬†Float¬†Shares
3. Liquidity - Also a no brainer, considering the number of shares immediately available for the public, and the hype around the stock.

It doesn't take a genius to see it. As insiders sell shares, the ‚Äúeffective float‚Äù rose, requiring extra purchases from index providers, and helping Palantir insiders exit.

[Vanguard = Liquidity ](https://preview.redd.it/630t26f5vy2e1.jpg?width=801&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b54299e2988d9b42437fe9eb7d9db3f407cf904b)

**Part 2: Buying a Seat at the Table**

2021-2022 was tough for Palantir. The index game was faltering as net income and revenue growth lagged. This threatened their ultimate goal of S&P500 + Nasdaq 100 inclusion. They had the market cap, if they could only find a way to juice their revenue in a profitable way to get themselves over the inclusion requirements!

So, they did what any reasonable company in this situation would do, and bought customers. Financing customer growth by¬†[investing roughly $450MM in over two dozen SPACs](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-29/palantir-failed-to-spot-pattern-in-spac-debacle), Palantir was basically¬†[buying revenue.](https://www.newcomer.co/p/is-palantir-buying-revenue)

The process was straightforward:

1. PLTR would invest in the SPAC and assume a significant controlling interest
2. PLTR would use the SPAC's funds to purchase PLTR services
3. Any operating losses of the SPAC company could be carefully hidden from PLTR's reporting.

[Not part of operating income!](https://preview.redd.it/ydfikqj6vy2e1.jpg?width=1254&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19a6a7d123b4cf926e5dd07b1ce374ac30061bb2)

And, soon enough, PLTR was (technically) reporting profitability by GAAP standards! With the company now profitable, in 2024 it became eligible for SP500 inclusion, and was included in September 2024, coinciding with a face-melting rally.

**Part 3: The Next Frontier**

To wind out its strategy, Palantir wants to maximize the benefits of index inclusion, capped off by its¬†**relisting to Nasdaq**¬†to position itself for entry into the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ).

The timing of the move is also suspect. The index‚Äôs modified market cap weighting system limits the concentration of its top three constituents, disproportionately favoring mid-tier companies ranked between #10 and #30 in market cap‚Äîexactly where Palantir has maneuvered itself.

This move is no coincidence. Palantir‚Äôs ownership by the big three institutional investors‚ÄîVanguard, BlackRock, and State Street‚Äîhas soared to an impressive¬†**22.23%**, surpassing even tech giants like¬†**Microsoft (20.5%)**,¬†**Apple (20.0%)**, and¬†**NVIDIA (20.17%)**. For a company that only went public in Q4-2020, this level of institutional backing is ridiculous for a company of this size.

And the insiders? They're loving the exit liquidity.

In fact, they've been dumping into the institutions (and retail) this whole time:

https://preview.redd.it/2p4k1qx7vy2e1.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b0be708d61438cdcf2e779d1216cd3e9696140a

""Show me the incentive, and I will tell you the outcome.""

Institutional shareholders through indexes are the easiest exit liquidity in the world for insiders. They're brainless, rules-based buyers. And, once the entire world owns an equal share of your company, priced at 50x sales, and you've dumped most of your shares, you could give a fuck less what the market ultimately does with your stock!

Of course, index inclusion for this stock has coincided with a complete disconnect from the fundamentals. The net \~3B of projected inflows from the QQQ have contributed about 40-50B of market cap growth in just the past few weeks.

Overall, I think there's huge problems with how companies are intentionally trying to juice themselves into indexes, knowing it's full of bloat and thoughtless exit liquidity. PLTR is just one of many, and they're giving a master class in index manipulation as we speak.

TL;DR: The recent PLTR tweet about joining the QQQ was a deeper insight into strategic yet dubious decisions the company has made for years in order to increase institutional ownership to fund insider selling and pump the stock outside of business fundamentals."
$MARA DD - The MaraStrategy üíä,"üì¢Preface

Disclaimer: I use a cringe amount of emoji ü´£ also the following is not not financial advice. If you lose money that's too bad, you gain a life lesson.

Illiterate? => Scroll to the bottom, follow instructions üëá

Disclosure: As of Nov 22nd I have \~8k in various $MARA calls + some additional funds to buy $MARA stock on dips. I will instantly buy more if Fred Thiel keeps employing the ""MaraStrategy""

Most of this DD focuses on $MARA compared to $MSTR, I compared multiple tickers before determining $MARA was the best play.

With that out of the way, lets dive into the always sunny bull case for $MARA  
\---

üíäMaraStrategy

For this section please humor me by assuming it is near impossible for $BTC to go down and it just continues going up. Think: 'sToNkS oNlY gO uP' type shit üòå

Thanks to the pioneers and investors in MicroStrategy an asymmetrical opportunity has presented itself. $MARA or Marathon Digital Holdings mines bitcoin and holds bitcoin, a shit-ton of it. In fact its the largest mining company by market cap with the largest $BTC holdings after $MSTR.

The ""MaraStrategy"" (codename: üíä) is an ambitious prospect of acquiring, holding and utilizing $BTC. Basically borrowing money against its holdings to buy $BTC and in turn providing that investment opportunity to its shareholders. $MSTR CEO Michael Saylor has derived this creative business model that is pushing both industry and the world at large into securing $BTC holdings. A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind, highly recommend listening to his vision for bitcoin from interviews on youtube.

$MARA happens to be in the best position to replicate what $MSTR is doing.  
\- They have plenty of expertise and experience within the sector.  
\- A forward thinking CEO (s/o Fredüëã) who has already began executing the MicroStrategy model.  
\- One of the strongest mining operations.  
\- Fresh infrastructure investment prepped for halving.  
\- A growing reputation of HODLing $BTC. ¬†

So why not just buy $MSTR? ""They were first!"" They will come out on top... right? Yes and no. They are currently utilizing their $BTC holdings better than anyone else. However, the $BTC value per share would be reduced if everyone just kept buying in, driving it higher as shares are diluted. $MSTR still has to pay their ""debts"" over time (which is crucial because $BTC takes time to go up \[I'm simplifying this slightly\]). Plus their option premiums are pricey üò§

We are starting to see other companies switching from purely fiat currency to diversified holdings with $BTC, daily.

To be clear I am not saying $MSTR is done running at all. My conviction is simply that $MARA presents an asymmetrical opportunity to get (fuck you) money from (irresponsible) option positions because it is an early adopter of the same strategy and is currently wildly undervalued by comparison ü§ë

Hopefully you kept in mind what I said about $BTC not going down, it helps understand the premise.  
Also its true (facts no cap on god frfr), $BTC is just going to keep rising, its inevitable. Although if it has a big dipperino all this goes to shit... but its a bull market so we're throwing caution to the wind üôÉ  
\---

ü§ØCatalysts

If I can ask you to only read and consider one of these, really have a deep think üß† on the first one, the rest are bonuses:

‚Çøitcoin - I was a skeptic years ago, now adoption is imminent. Bitcoin is the world's reserve currency. The biggest catalyst of all is the value of $BTC and the fact it's being adopted by EVERY person, EVERY business and EVERY country. The people drove the companies to invest and the companies are driving the countries to invest. Read it again. It's a rich man's world and they are going to want to ensure their wealth is secured. Without getting into the weeds you have to acknowledge fiat currency is inferior in some ways. Bitcoin's monetary value fluctuates, its use-cases expand but fundamentally its societal value is static and has remained intact since manifestation. No one knows what price $BTC is going to but I bet my dick it's much higher than 100k üöÄ

Continued aggressive purchasing of $BTC, the sooner the better. Fred Theil needs to show he's committed to following the MaraStrategy model. Then he needs to utilize the holdings to purchase against for more $BTC and to expand operations because the main business needs to also benefit from the increased holding for shareholder value.

Investors flooding in from both retail and institutional have been a huge driving factor of bitcoins positive price action. It is easier to access bitcoin now because you don't have to directly buy $BTC, $MSTR, $IBIT and now $MARA give simple, cheap and liquid ways to diversify in $BTC as fiat currency loses some ""market share"" to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin commonly held by public companies/governments like the transition from paper to software it is undoubtedly going to be a critical investment in the future and holding out means losing out. Especially for public companies where cash holdings are scrutinized, do you really believe undiversified cash reserves are going to remain competitive? Chew on this, $BTC has increased in value as fiat currencies are depreciating and we have seen $MSTR has been outperforming a majority of companies, less than a year ago it was valued at less than 10B now its valued 10x higher at nearly 100B, they have 33B in $BTC alone. This isn't some small cap ssq run up, it's leveraged to the tits ü´¶ but its achieving incredible value.

Infinite Money Glitch ü§Ø $BTC goes up, which means $MARA's holdings go up, profits per coin from mining goes up, stock goes up, allows them to buy more $BTC, $BTC goes up ‚ôªÔ∏è $MARA has the perfect supporting business for this they are literally PRINTING MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, must be funny.

There is a critical mass where companies and countries all start jumping in, buying $BTC and that causes $BTC to go fucking parabolic and $MARA to go marabolic -- its about to be a goddamn gold rush and picks ‚õèÔ∏è are on sale.

Small positives but worth noting  
\- Mining stocks are finally catching up to $BTC giving some extra momentum and volume  
\- China does the most mining in the world and its courts just confirmed $BTC is property and therefore is now legal for cities to own.  
\- With all Crypto rising $MARA can also mine other coins if it makes sense, they have pivoted before to coins providing better financial value.  
\- Saylor just tweeted ""$MARA is a company on the #Bitcoin Standard."" We have Daddy's approval üòè  
¬†\---

ü§ìNumbers

I had break my üö´ no math on weekends rule to write this, ain't it sad?

I am only going to go over $MARA compared to $MSTR, they have the most bitcoins and $MSTR is $MARA's biggest competitor. Numbers are from Nov 21st, assume a $BTC value of 98k. Premium calculations are taken from u/Jazzlike_Record_8915 on Reddit, they obviously fluctuate daily but I am just using them to illustrate a point.

While the value of $MSTR is derived 99% from its $BTC holdings essentially making it just a proxy, $MARA has an operational business valued at $3B so lets factor that in to calculate the premium paid per Bitcoin.

Holdings Value (Bitcoin):  
\- $MARA $3.191B - $MSTR $32.457B  
¬†  
Gross Equity (Operating Company Value):  
\- $MARA $6.391B - $MSTR $32.957B  
¬†  
Net Equity (After Debt):  
\- $MARA $4.972B - $MSTR 24B  
¬†  
Market Cap:  
\- $MARA $7.92B - $MSTR $117B  
¬†  
Premium per share:  
\- $MARA 1.59x - $MSTR 4.87x  
¬†  
Implied price per $BTC  
\- $MARA $156k - $MSTR $477k

ü§î 156k vs 477k per $BTC

Ahaaaaahh! Do you like paying a 3x higher premium? I mean that shits just gonna keep inflating but my boy Fred, over at Marathon Digital Holdings, he's putting his business to work.

Last report states $MARA mined 717 $BTC in Oct, thats > 23 a day and \~8.6k $BTC a year. If they didn't purchase a single bitcoin for a year their holding would still grow 20% from mining alone üå±

Value wise there is no doubt $MARA > $MSTR.  
\---

üìäTechnical Analysis

The charts look fucking glorious, full on üêÇish, every chart in the market is pointing to $BTC rising. I only know how to do bargain bin TA for short term moves, check this guy out for the yearly picture, hes a freaking üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è at calling movement before it happens.  
[https://youtu.be/did1gn5LR0M?si=mApqSf4VrLcte2JK&t=518](https://youtu.be/did1gn5LR0M?si=mApqSf4VrLcte2JK&t=518)  
In his latest $MARA analysis he notes it to be incredibly bullish as it breaks above the current level ($24) toward $41 and if it can reach that it has a chance to really run ($100+), only 6 mins long and very thorough.  
\---

üòÆ‚Äçüí®Conclusion

$MARA so hot right now ü•µ

My apologies if the DD was a bit cooked, between the Twisted Teas and my self diagnosed ADHD, shit took a lot more time than I expected but it was worth it. If you want a better DD look at the $MSTR ones and apply the thesis, same same. Also I hand wrote this myself, no chatgpt, the least you could do is buy the stock or leave a fuckin' comment eh ü´µüßê  
\---

‚úäHow to Play - Buy, Hold, Repeat.

In my dreams I have a plan, my conviction is that $MARA hits at least $120 in 2025, but I'm not stopping there.  
You can try swing trading this shit but the moves will happen fast and sometimes in the pre-market, I think B&H is better.

Plays ordered by highest profit potential:  
\- üíéBuy options now, make the maximum on degenerate bets, rinse, repeat, reinvest - 20x your portfolio.  
\- üí∞Wait until $MARA starts deviating more from $MSTR and other mining companies, buy stock & 1 month out options and keep rolling profits into shares.  
\- üíµBuy stock now, take 25% out every time it doubles: $50, $75, $100, $125  
\- ü§°Wait until its too late.

Prepare for a significant NVDA pullback until the company reports more conclusively positive numbers on Blackwell ,"My breakdown touches upon: ¬†

1)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Overall market context; 2) NVDA specific policy changes coming under Trump administration¬†

Overall market context is important, especially if we are headed for a correction or a consolidation period after the period of exuberance we have seen across asset classes.¬†

The overall market has largely yawned at potential tariffs, regulatory framework, and possibility of more export controls to Chinese market that could be enacted under a second Trump administration. Ex Goldman analyst Robin Brooks has alerted that markets are discounting the prospect of tariffs and how their effects could be really damaging for equities in 2025 ([https://www.benzinga.com/24/11/42134031/markets-got-it-wrong-after-elections-prospects-of-tariffs-not-good-for-equities-vs-dollar-says-ex-goldman-sachs-analyst](https://www.benzinga.com/24/11/42134031/markets-got-it-wrong-after-elections-prospects-of-tariffs-not-good-for-equities-vs-dollar-says-ex-goldman-sachs-analyst)). I don‚Äôt know whether there is hyperbole here, and if tariffs will actually cause pain for stocks, but it is at least worrying that the market has not seemed to care at all now that we know Trump will take office in January.

Goldman Sachs‚Äô forecast shows robust 2.5% growth for the US economy in 2025, with slightly worst results if Trump enacts a 10% tariff on all imports. ([https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/2025-outlook-will-tailwinds-trump-tariffs/OutlooksFinalTranscript.pdf](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/2025-outlook-will-tailwinds-trump-tariffs/OutlooksFinalTranscript.pdf)) Frankly, I believe Goldmans‚Äô forecasting model is overly optimistic for two reasons. First, their estimates does not include a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imported goods, which Trump campaigned on. Nor does it include a scenario in which a large deportation program ‚Äì both of which could have the effect of suppressing economic growth if implemented.

Wage growth has largely slowed and consumers would feel fatigued if a new bout of inflation rips across the economy‚Äîthis would definitely have an impact on earnings. On top of this, a weakening labor market seems to threaten consumers‚Äô comfortability with rising prices again.

One could argue that Trump‚Äôs immigration policies, including his plan for a large deportation initiative could see a tighter labour market, and rising wages that could counter a weakening labor market and slowing wage growth. But it‚Äôs important to be cognizant of the fact that tariffs would happen instantly, whereas deportations take time, and their effects would not be felt immediately throughout the economy.

Now that I‚Äôve covered the overall market context, let‚Äôs get specific on NVDA.

Since NVDA reported earnings last week, the stock price has seesawed in pre-market trading as well as during trading hours. There has been plenty of pontification by market analysts either discounting or raising concerns about slowing sales growth and lower guidance going forward. The stock ended last week largely down, with significant selling happening on Friday.

But I want to focus on what‚Äôs in store for NVDA under a the administration.

Howard Lutnick, nominated by President-elect Donald Trump as Secretary of Commerce and USTR, has signaled his commitment to intensifying export controls on advanced semiconductors and related technologies to China. Lutnick‚Äôs statements and policy positions suggest a focus on maintaining U.S. dominance in critical technologies, particularly in the semiconductor sector, as a countermeasure to China's rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and military applications.

In a recent interview, Lutnick described semiconductors as ""the cornerstone of America's technological edge"" and emphasized that ""export controls are not merely economic tools but strategic weapons to protect our national security."" He has voiced strong support for continuing and expanding the Biden administration's measures, including targeting AI chips and semiconductor manufacturing tools.

Under Lutnick's guidance, policies could further restrict sales of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chips to China. He has highlighted concerns about these chips enabling advanced AI capabilities that could be leveraged by the Chinese military. Lutnick stated, ""We cannot afford to let cutting-edge American technology become a tool for our adversaries,"" signaling potential restrictions on Nvidia and other U.S. tech firms developing high-performance semiconductors.

¬†The implications of Lutnick's policies could be significant. Stricter controls on exports, including modifications to loopholes that allowed companies like Nvidia to tailor products for the Chinese market, might accelerate China's efforts toward semiconductor self-sufficiency. U.S. firms could face reduced revenues, but Lutnick argues that ""short-term sacrifices are essential for long-term strategic security‚Äù.

In addition, we cannot discount the Biden administration making last minute policy moves to box in opponents and make it harder for the new incoming administration to deviate. This has already been reported by Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/technology/chamber-commerce-sees-new-us-export-crackdown-china-email-says-2024-11-22/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chamber-commerce-sees-new-us-export-crackdown-china-email-says-2024-11-22/)). According to this report, the Biden administration is set to enact new regulations could make up to another 200 Chinese chip companies subject to a trade restriction list that bars most U.S. suppliers from shipping goods to the targeted firms. This news broke on Friday, but ten minutes before the market closed. If this is correct, it will put price pressure on the semiconductor sector, which could affect NVDA as well.

¬†I really do believe given this context, we are entering a period where NVDA could suffer, at least until we have more clarity on tariffs, export control regulations, and Blackwell sales numbers which won‚Äôt be reported on for some time.

The largest NVDA drawdowns that have happened recently (March-April; June-August; August-September) averaged anywhere between 21-30%. Smaller, more muted corrections have also occurred of around 10% in the stock since. A similar effect here (10% or so from its high of 152.88 would bring shares close to 137, and break through a key support level. A larger plunge could see it closer to 120 or below.

All in all, a dip here would be a good opportunity to buy up shares at a discounted price.

¬†I will be holding cash for buying on what I believe will be significant dips coming in the coming weeks, in the lead-up to inauguration and what will be a flurry of announcements as Trump will want to signal change and do so in true Trump fashion: loudly. ¬†

McDonald‚Äôs Espresso Machine Meltdown: $193M Burnt Nuggets or Billion-Dollar Golden Arches Play?,"This is weird. 

McDonald‚Äôs (MCD) is scrambling faster than a breakfast egg because their Melitta espresso machines just got yeeted out of every U.S. store. Safety concerns = no lattes, no cappuccinos, no mocha frappes. üçÆ A total 13,500 stores affected = $193M in financial black holes. But wait‚Äîit gets worse. If they don‚Äôt fix this fast, this could be McDonald‚Äôs ice cream machine scandal 2.0‚Äîwith espresso.

The Drama
You know how they‚Äôre always like, ‚ÄúSorry, the ice cream machine‚Äôs broken‚Äù? Well, now the espresso machines are dead too. McDonald‚Äôs had to RIP them out of every U.S. location because of some ‚Äúunspecified safety concern.‚Äù I mean, who‚Äôs getting hurt by a cappuccino? Karen‚Äôs third-degree burn from asking for ‚Äúextra hot‚Äù? üî•‚òï

The Numbers
Here‚Äôs where it gets wild, fam. McDonald‚Äôs serves 27.2M customers a day in the U.S.:
	‚Ä¢	810K espresso drinks lost per day = $2.4M/day in lost sales.
	‚Ä¢	People skipping meals because no coffee = another $1.2M/day gone.
	‚Ä¢	That‚Äôs $153M in lost profit if this drags on for 60 days.

NVDA may see red next week,"This isn‚Äôt bear porn and I‚Äôm going to get flamed for this one, but I think NVDA has a red week coming.  Earnings were very good, beating on both EPS and rev, but guidance came in conservative.  Gross margins were also down slightly to 74.6% from 75.1% in the previous quarter(still insane numbers).  The issue with this slight deceleration is that the stock is priced for exponential growth like we‚Äôve been seeing for a couple years now.  That ridiculous growth may be slowing down a little for now, and their new Blackwell chips are still rolling out.  We don‚Äôt know what kind of revenue those will bring in yet.  The stock got plenty of price hikes post earnings, but nothing too significant(160-170‚Äôs for the most part).  It just seems like the train is slowing down a bit.  

As far as the chart goes, it has tried to break and hold $149-150 7 times since November 6.  It briefly broke over the day after earnings, but was quickly bitch slapped back below that threshold.  IMO, this earnings report was the catalyst that it needed to get over that resistance, and it has clearly failed to do so. So the question is: where do we go from here?  We‚Äôre right on the trend line that it‚Äôs held since September 6.  We could go higher, but earnings failed to impress the market, and it doesn‚Äôt seem like we have enough gas to pump it higher just yet.  We saw some significant selling pressure today without any buyers stepping in EOD.  I think that trend continues Monday and we break the trend line.  That is a solid red daily candle today, and I expect to see a gap down and another candle just like that on Monday. I would love to see it hit the 100 day EMA(right around $130) and bounce from there.  Thats definitely the spot to load up on calls if you‚Äôre still bullish(which you should be).  

One more risk over the next few days and weeks:  geopolitical tensions.  Normally we just ignore everything Putin says, but the escalation of launching an Oreshnik ICBM and hitting Dnipro can not be ignored.  NATO is holding an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss this event.  There have been many escalations recently, with multiple countries now directly involved in the conflict.  Monitor it and tread carefully. "
$U - A potential game engine comeback story.,"Wanted to try it out so here's my first 'analysis'! Let me know if my points are valid and if my structuring is good or not.

Firstly for some background information, $U or Unity Software Inc is primarily game engine company where although producing a relatively good game engine, has made some incredibly poor choices - such as mass layoffs and diverging from their engine to focus more on advertising, merging with Iron Source. The company peaked in value November '21 at almost $200 (USD) where the company began merging with other companies, months after the decently successful IPO - the first merger being with Weta Digital. After that peak, it was all downhill from there tumbling into the $40s over the course of two years, where Unity made gaming history by announcing the runtime fee. This lead to the regarded CEO resigning (the CEO that once ran EA, go figure) and most of management being fired, with major restructuring a few months after occurring under interim CEO Jim Whitehurst and then Matthew Bromberg, where they promised to work on what truly mattered, the engine itself.

In recent times, Unity has made great strides in their engine with massive new features on the way - promising better performance (they don't say it, but they subtly hint it in their advertising that Unity is the engine for good performance, as opposed to Unreal), and new innovative uses of that big A word that investors climax over. They announced Unity 6, their big update and reversion back to a normal naming system as opposed to their weird yearly naming scheme (which was objectively bad for pressuring new releases on a yearly schedule), and announced 6.1 with some features currently in alpha releases, and some credible promises for later big versions which they appear committed on.

Overall, they seem to be on a comeback, at least on the engine side. Financially, they've been recovering from the whole runtime debacle (around Q4-23) where the next quarter being their first missed earnings for a while, by quite a bit as well. Where only recently in Q2-24 have they started to beat the target and are on track to go above $0 per share in the next two years. In addition, as a result of the cancellation of the runtime fee and the new CEO reaching out to businesses and the community, growth has been re-sparked. Moreover, their profits from their engine have increased 5% year over year and is still going strong. In the recent Q3 earnings their total profits in EBITDA is over 10% over their initial estimate of $70-80m at $92m.

My verdict, is that the company under its new leadership has shifted its focus towards the user. They are focussing on updating their engine without hurting users using older features, and are in the testing phases of new AI technologies for both advertising (reducing ROI and boosting user acquisition + monetary gain), and game development (with two AI systems for both helping developers make games, and running AI within games for either NPCs or game systems). Thus, after a 'company reset' they seem to be on the track to make a profit and become the defacto game engine - one that won't be made fun of crappy games.

Disclaimer - this is not financial advice. I'm a game developer and I enjoy using their engine (which is how I can say the engine is getting far better in recent releases for engine users), I recently got into trading/investing and I read these analysis posts or bets, and I decided to try one out myself.

How'd I do?

Edit: MB forgor to say my position. I'm dirt poor so I put $70 in Unity at around $17usd with 5x leverage... if that means anything to u guys?"
I Think PayPal is Still Very Undervalued ,"**11/22/24**

As the title states, I believe PayPal Holdings, Inc. is still very undervalued. With a YTD return of +41.60%, and 5-year return of -16.46%, there is still a lot of room to recover.

PayPal Holdings, Inc. is a digital payment and transaction company that connects consumers to businesses worldwide. On top of this, they have a large presence in the P2P payment market. They are essentially a digital wallet allowing you to store all of your payment and banking information. They also provide loans to businesses and individuals through their buy now pay later program. Through their facilitation of digital payments, they have a presence in 200 countries and receive tons of traffic. In 2023, PayPal alone processed $1.53 trillion dollars in payment volume, a 12% increase YoY. This is an extremely large and well-established company with 27,200 employees, bringing in north of $30 billion in revenue.

**Main Subsidiaries**

[PayPal's Main Subsidiaries ](https://preview.redd.it/uewklqydgi2e1.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0cbd3ddd160b9a994e23123abf51dbf7cd53668)

**Venmo Highlights**

**Total Payment Volume - $276 billion. 13.1 % increase YoY**

**2023 Net income - $1.1 billion. 18.2% increase YoY**

**Very fast-growing platform displaying consistent user growth, TPV growth, and active account growth.** Venmo is currently only in the US, which I think represents a good potential opportunity for expansion into foreign markets.

[Venmo Annual Users](https://preview.redd.it/z0e1vglgli2e1.png?width=409&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea56768256c9b5faaa3c38c6c1ffa398be30630e)

The market size for digital transactions is estimated to grow at a double-digit CAGR from 2024-2032. The largest growth coming from the Asia-Pacific region. PayPal is able to capitalize on this by their facilitation of cross-border transactions. Just think of the increase in digital transactions you've experienced in the past 5 years. Cash is becoming obsolete; everything is turning digital. This is great for PayPal as 90% of their revenue comes from transactions.

[Digital Payment Market \(Global Market Insights\)](https://preview.redd.it/hyrilx1yhi2e1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdf2abebba434c3c075aece53b3dd96cc0b1b6de)

Increases in digital payment transactions demonstrates a positive correlation with PayPal TPV.

**PayPal Holdings, Inc. Q3 2024 Highlights**

**Transaction Revenue - $7,067 billion. 6% increase YoY**

**Total Revenue - $7,847 billion. 6% increase YoY**

**Total Payment Transactions - $6,631 billion. 6% increase YoY**

**Transactions Per Active Account - 61.4. 9% increase YoY**

**Total Payment Volume - $422,641 billion. 9% increase YoY**

**Conclusion -** I believe the market for digital payments and transactions is very young, bound to experience tremendous growth in the coming years. As the dominant player in this market, PayPal Holdings, Inc. is incredibly well poised to grow. It is simple, the more transactions that take place, the more money the company makes. While this is a very competitive market, if we focus on the fundamentals of the company, all of the answers are there. They have a very good balance sheet and good management that is taking initiatives to grow and expand their brand. All of their numbers represent consistent growth YoY, and this is very likely to continue\*\*. At a current price of **$86.51**\*\*, I believe this company will soar easily back to the **$100+ range and beyond.**"
MARA vs MSTR vs HUT: Bitcoin treasury comparisons,"https://preview.redd.it/6dhobb43hi2e1.png?width=971&format=png&auto=webp&s=362823b3680fec6fb1b8186bf1717e49f46c2920

I made a comparison of the top btc-linked equities who own the most btc... a) MSTR, b) MARA, and c) HUT ... i want to preface this by saying¬†*all*¬†BTC-linked equities deserve¬†*some*¬†premia in a bull market. The question is how much & when.

MSTR was trading at $478K per bitcoin yesterday morning... so yesterday's correction was *good*¬†news... it re-rated... to <$400K per bitcoin... i have a feeling the premia is gona expand again though and Saylor will tap the convert markets 3-4x more from now until the Spring. The stock can double from here. Because MSTR's software operations are winding down, it justifies its premia by promising it will be a sort of 'bitcoin bank' in the future. TBD.

MARA was never really known on Wall Street for its HODL, but since the shares were flat as BTC went from $60K to $90K, the HODL now puts it in the top 3 BTC treasury plays. In the past, 80-90% of MARA's market cap was attributable to its operating company: the mining facilities. That has now changed. It's become more & more of a BTC proxy. This is a monumental shift. I didn't believe it 100% until I crunched the numbers, and looked at their latest debt offering... MARA is a top 2 mining/HODL play. It's a new landscape for miners.

HUT was always known as the classic HODL play if you didn't want to touch MSTR... especially as BTC ETFs didn't have any options contracts. If you wanted levered long BTC exposure, you had to either play MSTR or HUT. When MSTR got out of control, traders looked to call options on HUT to get that levered long exposure. HUT is still the biggest HODL play in the mining arena, and due to the recent underperformance, it's also the best value (in terms of cheapest price per BTC). HUT shareholders have also been much less diluted than MARA shareholders, and HUT's float is much tighter than MARA's. Furthermore, HUT's short intrst is double MARA's, creating extra volatility. I suspect the options market on HUT will begin to price this in as HUT shares begin to move again, but nobody knows. They can always sink too. HUT's smaller size has the added benefit of making it a more realistic M&A target (for both corporates and PE), which is always a nice uplift due to the premia often paid to shareholders in a buyout scenario. I like both HUT and MARA at these levels.

$PACS a potential x3 bagger,"First DD, not sure I am doing it right  
  
**TL;DR: Risky bet on recovery of $PACS after potential dismissal of covid-era fraud**  
**I've been long PACS for a while**   
**Positions: (see screenshot)**  
  
Excellent DD by another regard: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fgnku5/pacs\_prestige\_acquisition\_finalized\_so\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fgnku5/pacs_prestige_acquisition_finalized_so_earnings/)  


$PACS - skilled nursing facilities (SNF) assisted living facilities in the USA (in short Nursing home)  
Provides senior care and independent facilities, buy/lease real-estate for health care related properties

Founded in Utah in 2013, IPO in 2024  
Similar company: $ENSG  
Revenue: Coming from leasing facilities and insurance reimbursement based on the number of residents  
Finalized acquisition by taking over operations of Prestige Care‚Äôs entire SNF portfolio i.e 56 facilities across 6 states and added 2889 skilled nursing beds

Occupancy rate of 94% for all facilities they have managed for 18 months  
  
Why PACS? 

Hindenburg research made a claim that PACS is inflating their numbers by abusing covid era waiver to make more money as well as misleading investors with wrong CMS ratings.  
The claim is that the same revenue cannot be achieved and possibly fraud

What's the waiver about? It allowed beneficiaries to receive Medicare-covered SNF care without a prior hospital stay of at least three days. It expired with the end of the federal Public Health Emergency (PHE) on¬†**May 11, 2023**

=> PACS have seen a sharp decline after those allegations leading to more than 60% decline, below it's IPO price!

Furthermore, they delayed their earnings because of that only releasing preliminary earnings: [https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/113/pacs-group-provides-preliminary-third-quarter-operational-metrics](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/113/pacs-group-provides-preliminary-third-quarter-operational-metrics)

So:

\* Based on it they are still beating expectations and they stated that they are aware of those allegations and working with government entities and another 3rd party audit to make sure that they were always compliant.   
\* Fraud allegations are not related to cooked books but rather using Covid-era to pump up revenue  
\* Covid era waiver is long gone but revenue is still up  
  
This could go both ways: if the claim made by Hindenburg research was actually wrong PACS could easily go back to $40 (i.e almost doubling current price)  
If it was indeed true, expect PACS a loss of revenue in the next earning release or two but **the nursing facilities and occupancies aren't going away**.

"Big win with $hims, FDA didn‚Äôt side with pharma like everyone thought they wouldüíäüìà
","**Background:**

* **GLP-1 Demand :** Wegovy (Novo) and Zepbound are dominating the branded weight-loss markets but face demand that they cannot keep up with.
* **Trump‚Äôs Legacy:** Under the Trump administration, rules around drug compounding were clarified, allowing pharmacies to fill gaps during shortages. Now, these policies will be central to ongoing lawsuits ([see this executive order](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-ensuring-essential-medicines-medical-countermeasures-critical-inputs-made-united-states/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=ncl_amplify&utm_campaign=230724-agenda47_returning_production_of_essential_medicines_back_to_america_and_ending_bidens_pharmaceutical_shortages&utm_content=ncl-7CGRrbfsEr&_nlid=7CGRrbfsEr&_nhids=NJKu9Lb)).
* **FDA issues:** The FDA pulled tirzepatide (Zepbound/Mounjaro) from the shortage list in October but has since walked back on this after legal challenges, extending the compounding window significantly.

**Why It Matters:**

* **HIMS‚Äô Edge:** FDA uncertainty + Trump-era compounding policies = opportunity for HIMS to take over affordable GLP-1 market.
* **GLP-1 Customer base:** There are even more GLP-1 customers than expected which leaves a huge opportunity to take advantage of.  There is [over 6% of the U.S.](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/#:~:text=Overall%2C%2012%25%20of%20adults%20say,Obesity%20Drugs%20for%20Racial%20Disparities) taking a variant of it currently.
* **Hims Undervalued:** Hims is currently significantly undervalued due to the risk of lawsuits and competitors. My research into their competitors showed that they are not great considering some like RO health require a $145 month subscription to be prescribed GLP-1 which is another $300 a month subscription on top of that vs HIMS being a flat rate $200 a month which includes free chatting with a doctor anytime.
* **Hims In-house Compounding Advantage:** Hims acquired their own [compounding pharmacy](https://news.hims.com/newsroom/building-our-pharmacy-operations-with-the-customer-in-mind) to produce their drugs. This allows them to control the quality and ensure their customers get what they order which is important with compounded drugs. They recently got a [global head of quality & safety](https://investors.hims.com/news/news-details/2024/Hims--Hers-Appoints-Tenured-Pharmaceutical-Regulatory-and-Quality-Experts-to-Key-Leadership-Positions/default.aspx) who has over 30 years in pharma and FDA so the FDA cannot say it is unsafe to compound.
* **Big Pharma Hit:** Lilly and Novo stocks have been tumbling for the past few months due to the wavering support for Medicare/Medicaid covering their drugs for anti-obesity which is now very unlikely to pass with RFK being staunchly against it. It is still possible to get it if you have an added health benefit like Obesity + diabetes etc.

**Takeaway:**

* FDA delays + Trump rules = lifeline for $HIMS. The compounded drug wave could crash if regulators tighten up but the price is already undervalued. This becomes more unlikely further into the Trump presidency as cutting off a European company that has the GDP of Denmark aligns with their goals.

Oh, and Hims added meal replacements today. Branching out and adding more streams of revenue that align with their goals is a +1 in my book.

**TL;DR**: Hims & Hers ($HIMS) was up 11% as the FDA delayed its decision on Eli Lilly‚Äôs ($LLY[) Zepbound and Mounjaro shortage status](https://www.barrons.com/articles/eli-lilly-zepbound-wegovy-hims-hers-stock-8e6d9861). This pause keeps compounders going and sets precedence for HIMS when Semaglutide¬†is removed from shortage list. There is also Trumps past executive order which will most likely be pushed through to this situation if the court cases are dragged out. European companies like Novo would be significantly impacted by this and the trump administration will take this as a win.

Positions:

1500 shares & 10 calls @$20 1/16/26"
Keep an eye on NKE,"We haven‚Äôt heard anything about it in a while.  The last earnings call was pretty bad.  Sales tanked 10% yoy and EPS dropped 26%.  Over the past few years, management decided it was a good idea to focus more on the direct-to-consumer business and took product away from store shelves.  This has proven to be a poor decision, as that business has dropped 13%.   On September 19,  Nike announced Elliot Hill will be the new CEO.  The market loved the move as the stock popped about 12%, but it has since sold off to retest the lows.  Hill is expected to get Nike back on track, but that will take time.  Bill Ackman has upped his stake in NKE recently, going from 2% to 11% of his total portfolio, and Travis Knight(Phil Knight‚Äôs son) acquired 3,180,000 shares 3 weeks ago, increasing his stake by 170%.   New CEO Elliot Hill also bought 64,000 shares last month.  

As far as the chart goes, it‚Äôs at a very important level.   The $68-70 range has been crucial since before the pandemic.  It was resistance in 2015 and 2018, and support in 2018 once it broke through.  It blasted through this level during covid, but that was an extreme circumstance.  You can see it was also support recently in August after the earnings sell off.  It has since bounced but may be testing the support one more time for a double bottom.  I think it‚Äôs going to be very difficult for it to break through this level.  Nike is the premier athletic brand.  They have more revenue that LULU, ON cloud, and Adidas combined.  They‚Äôll figure their shit out, and will get back on track.  

I included the daily chart as well.  I was looking for a retest and hold of $70 to confirm the double bottom, but today had a really candle.  Looking to tomorrow to see if that trend continues.  I doubt they‚Äôll crush earnings this time, but there could be a small run into the report on 12/19, some $80 and $85 calls for 12/20 in hopes of that run and to play the IV as well.  BOL if tailing."
